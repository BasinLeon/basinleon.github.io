### 1. THE REFINERY MODEL
All data must flow through a three-stage refinery:
1. **Raw Signal**: CRM, LinkedIn, Financial News.
2. **Audited Intent**: Secondary agents verify the signal in real-time.
3. **Logic Gate**: A code-based decision (True/False) before outreach.

### 2. DATA OWNERSHIP
- No PII is stored in transient agent memory.
- All high-intent signals must be committed to a versioned CSV or Database.
