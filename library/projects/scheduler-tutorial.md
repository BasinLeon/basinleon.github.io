# 🏗️ PROJECT: DISTRIBUTED JOB SCHEDULER TUTORIAL
## Building Reliable Systems with AI Agents

This project serves as a cornerstone of the BASIN::NEXUS portfolio and a masterclass for the upcoming Udemy course.

### 1. THE PROBLEM
Most engineers use `cron` or simple loops until they fail at scale. We are building a **Distributed, Idempotent Scheduler** using Python, Redis, and Postgres.

### 2. CORE FEATURES
- **Scalable Workers**: Add/Remove workers dynamically.
- **Idempotency**: Ensure a job only runs once, even on network failure.
- **Retry Backoff**: Exponential backoff for failed tasks.
- **Observability**: A real-time dashboard of job states (Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed).

### 3. THE "AGENTIC" ANGLE (The Secret Sauce)
This tutorial doesn't just teach code; it teaches how to **build with agents**:
- **Squad Formation**: Use a Builder/Tester/Auditor squad to write the core logic.
- **Protocol Enforced**: Apply `PROTOCOLS/coding-rules.md` to ensure high-aesthetic code.
- **Risk Ladders**: Determine when an agent can auto-retry a job vs when it needs human approval.

### 4. ROADMAP
1. **Week 1**: Scaffolding & Redis Queue.
2. **Week 2**: Worker logic & Postgres Persistence.
3. **Week 3**: Idempotency & Error Handling.
4. **Week 4**: Dashboard & Agentic Governance.
