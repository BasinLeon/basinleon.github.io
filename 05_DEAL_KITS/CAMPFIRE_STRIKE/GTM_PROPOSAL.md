# GTM ENGINEERING PROPOSAL: CAMPFIRE
## RE: Scaling Revenue Infrastructure through Automation

**To:** Andrew Greener & Campfire Leadership
**From:** Leon Basin

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Go-to-market execution is no longer just a volume game; it requires a deep technical foundation. I am applying for the GTM Engineer role not as a traditional "ops" hire, but as an engineer who builds the systems Sales, Marketing, and Success need to scale.

My approach is focused on building durable revenue infrastructure that eliminates manual toil and data inconsistencies.

### CORE CAPABILITIES & ALIGNMENT

**1. Building the "Logic" for Scale**
I don't just set up sequences; I build the technical logic for lead routing and enrichment. My approach to "Lead-to-Opportunity" workflows ensures that we are acting on market signals (tech stack shifts, hiring mandates, funding) in real-time, reducing response latency and maximizing team yield.

**2. Revenue Systems Engineering**
At Campfire, the goal is "scaling the go-to-market engine." I specialize in:
- Workflow Automation: Turning complex business requirements into reliable, automated processes using tools like Python, n8n, and Clay.
- Data Fidelity: Ensuring the CRM is a clean, real-time reflection of our market opportunities, not a list of stale leads.
- Actionable Visibility: Building dashboards and alerts that show leadership exactly where the friction is in the pipeline.

**3. Startup Execution**
I have a builder mindset. I’ve built GTM systems from the ground up at startups like Sense and Fudo Security, focusing on speed and technical reliability. I thrive in ambiguous environments because I enjoy solving those ambiguities with code and clear process.

### MEASURABLE IMPACT
My work is driven by a commitment to building assets, not just motion. Throughout my career, I have managed $300M+ in enterprise portfolios and built automated systems that have generated over $30M in lifetime pipeline.

I am ready to help Campfire bridge the gap between strategy and execution.
