*   **Action:** Connect, build rapport, then Pivot immediately.
*   **Say:** "Ola briefed me on the vision. I didn't come here to interview for a job. I came to show you how we build the **US Landing Zone**."

## 2. THE INTELLIGENCE (Show You Know Them)
*   **Open File:** `2_INTEL_Briefing.html`
*   **Say:** "I prepared this Mission Dossier. I know your model: you have a powerful backend in the UAE, but you have a 'Trust Gap' in the US. This document outlines exactly where you are losing revenue."
*   *Walk them through the 'Strategic Gap' section (Risk Factors).*

## 3. THE DEMO (Show The Engine)
*   **Open File:** `1_DEMO_Dashboard.html`
*   **Say:** "We don't just talk strategy; we build sovereign infrastructure. I already have a signal running for SecureMC."
*   **Click:** The 'SecureMC' card (Gold Pulse).
*   **Say:** "This is the War Room. This is how I will track every lead your team generates, ensuring nothing slips through the cracks."

## 4. THE ASK (The Methodology)
*   **Open File:** `3_DEAL_Framework.html`
*   **Say:** "Now, how do we work together? I structure my partnerships for stability and aggression."
*   **Show Option B (Founding Partner):** "I recommend the **Founding Partner** model. You get a dedicated US Managing Partner to run the entity, and we align on profit share. It keeps your fixed costs reasonable while giving you elite execution."
