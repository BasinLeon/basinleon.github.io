# GTM ENGINEERING PROPOSAL: BUYERSIGHT
## RE: Scaling GTM through Automated Workflows

**To:** Scott Lichtenstein & BuyerSight Leadership
**From:** Leon Basin

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
GTM execution is evolving from a manual volume game to a technical optimization game. I am applying for the GTM Engineer role to help BuyerSight bridge the gap between AI tooling and repeatable revenue outcomes through a technical-first and product-centered approach.

My methodology involves treating the go-to-market engine as a technical asset, powered by custom workflows in Clay and N8N.

### CORE CAPABILITIES & ALIGNMENT

**1. Workflow Design (Clay & N8N)**
I specialize in building end-to-end automated systems that turn raw data into qualified meetings. I don't just "use" tools like Clay; I build the logic layers that ingestion multi-source signals (tech stack shifts, hiring, market intent) to ensure every outbound campaign is contextually relevant and highly targeted.

**2. Data Scraping & Enrichment**
I have extensive experience building ingestion pipelines using N8N and various scraping tools (Apify, Serper, Trigify). At BuyerSight, I would focus on:
- High-Fidelity Ingestion: Orchestrating workflows that pull from Google Maps, LinkedIn, and proprietary sources into a unified engine.
- Automated Account Prioritization: Using data-driven logic to replace manual prospecting with a vertical, signal-rich approach.

**3. Tool Management & Scalability**
I am proficient in the latest outbound tech stack (Smartlead, Instantly) and CRM platforms. My focus is on maintaining high signal-to-noise ratios, ensuring email deliverability, and building systems that allow the team to scale without increasing manual headcount.

### PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND
Throughout my career, I have managed $300M+ in enterprise portfolios and built systems that have generated over $30M in lifetime pipeline. I am a builder who enjoys the intersection of sales strategy and technical problem-solving.

I am ready to help BuyerSight lead the transition to AI-native go-to-market execution.
