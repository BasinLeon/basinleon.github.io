# 🎙️ JAMES BATTLE CARD (BRM.ai) - 11:00 AM
**Persona:** The Architect (Few Words)

---

## 1. THE OPENING
"James – Looking forward to this. I've been refining the architecture for the March influx (5k leads) we discussed. Ready to dive in."

## 2. THE CORE (Show the Q1 Architecture PDF)
"The goal is simple:
1. **Filter:** Immediate check for Coupa/Brex usage.
2. **Enrich:** Identify the 'Category Manager' for SaaS spend.
3. **Route:** Top 5% hit Slack in real-time (< 2 mins)."

## 3. THE SUBTLE FLEX (Code)
"We're using a Python-native listener to catch the signal before it decays in the CRM. It eliminates the 'Human Void' entirely."

## 4. THE ASK
"I'm ready to deploy this on Day 1. Where’s the biggest friction point in your GTM right now?"
