            response: `**Revenue as Architecture, Not Arithmetic**

My core belief: Revenue isn't about "more calls = more deals." It's about designing systems that route the right signal to the right action at the right time.

**The 3 Pillars:**
1. **SIGNAL** — Where data enters (webhooks, sheets, APIs)
2. **SYSTEM** — Where intelligence forms (scoring, enrichment, routing)
3. **SCALE** — Where outputs multiply (briefs, emails, CRM updates)

Traditional GTM is linear. Mine is recursive — the system learns from every interaction.

**The $800K Insight:** I don't add headcount. I replace it with architecture.`

            response: `**SIGNAL → SYSTEM → SCALE Framework**

**Layer 1: SIGNAL (Input)**
- Google Sheets, RSS feeds, LinkedIn webhooks
- Funding announcements, hiring patterns, tech stack changes
- 50k+ signals/day monitored across 7 sources

**Layer 2: SYSTEM (Processing)**
- Python + LLMs score each signal (0-100)
- n8n workflows route high-intent leads automatically
- Enrichment APIs add contact data, tech stack, persona

**Layer 3: SCALE (Output)**
- Auto-generate personalized cold emails
- Create executive briefs for board meetings
- Update CRM, send Slack alerts, trigger sequences

**The Magic:** 1 human + 1 system = 10 SDRs worth of output.

**Real Results:** +160% pipeline YoY at Fudo, $424K projected savings for Ambient.`

**Pipeline Metrics:**
- **Signal-to-SQL Conversion:** 8-12% (vs. 2-4% industry avg)
- **Cost per Qualified Lead:** $18 (vs. $150 industry avg)
- **Velocity:** 23 days to first meeting (vs. 45 days avg)

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- **Toil Reduction:** -92% manual research time
- **Output Multiplication:** +50% more outreach with same headcount
- **ROI:** $424K annual savings on 10-SDR equivalent workload

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Reply Rate:** 15-22% (cold outbound)
- **Meeting Show Rate:** 78%
- **SQL-to-Opp:** 45%

**How I Measure Success:**
Not "how many calls" but "how much signal captured per dollar spent."`

            keywords: ['vision', 'future', 'goal', 'direction', 'want to', 'looking for', 'next'],
            response: `**My Vision for GTM**

**The Problem:** Most companies still operate like it's 2015. They hire SDRs to "smile and dial" through bad lists, burning $150K/year per rep on 2% conversion rates.

**The Opportunity:** AI + No-code tools make it possible to build autonomous revenue engines that:
- Monitor 50k signals/day (impossible for humans)
- Score and route leads in real-time
- Generate personalized outreach at scale
- Free humans to do what they do best: close deals

**What I Want to Build:**
A company where the GTM function is *engineered*, not managed. Where:
- Every SDR has an AI co-pilot that feeds them pre-qualified, researched leads
- Every AE gets auto-generated battle cards before every call
- Every executive gets real-time pipeline intelligence, not month-old spreadsheets

**The Role I'm Seeking:**
Director/VP of GTM Engineering — where I can build this vision from scratch.

**Why I'll Win:** Because I've already built it. Now I just need a company ambitious enough to deploy it.`

            response: `**How I Build GTM Strategy**

**Step 1: Signal Identification**
- What buyer behaviors indicate intent?
  (e.g., hiring a CISO = security budget unlocked)
- What triggers create urgency?
  (e.g., funding round = new tools evaluation)

**Step 2: System Design**
- How do we capture these signals?
- How do we score them?
  (Recency + magnitude + fit = priority score)
- How do we route them?
  (High-intent → AE, Low-intent → nurture)

**Step 3: Scale Execution**
- What templates work for each persona?
- What sequences convert best?
- What bottlenecks exist?

**Example:**
At Fudo Security, I identified that "recently hired CISO at Series B" was a 10x signal. Built a system to monitor LinkedIn + Crunchbase, auto-enrich contacts, and generate personalized "congrats on new role" emails. 

**Result:** 18% reply rate, 160% pipeline increase YoY.

**The Principle:** Strategy without system is just PowerPoint.`

**Orchestration:** n8n (free, self-hosted Zapier alternative)

**Data Sources:**
- Google Sheets (free pipeline tracking)
- RSS feeds (company news, funding announcements)
- LinkedIn webhooks (hiring signals)
- Clearbit/Hunter APIs (free tiers for enrichment)

**Processing:**
- Python + Pandas (scoring logic)
- Local LLMs via Ollama (free GPT-4 alternative)
- Streamlit (free app hosting)

**Output:**
- Gmail API (auto-send sequences)
- Slack webhooks (team alerts)
- PDF generation (executive briefs)

**Total Monthly Cost:** $0 (vs. $950+/mo for Outreach + ZoomInfo + Clay)

**Why This Matters:**
I can deploy enterprise-grade GTM infrastructure for a startup with zero budget. That's the competitive advantage — speed without spend.`

            keywords: ['interview', 'hire', 'candidate', 'recruit', 'assess', 'job'],
            response: `**How I Approach Interviews (Both Sides)**

**When I'm the Candidate:**
- I don't "interview" — I consult
- Show up with a pro bono case study already built
- Ask: "What's the blocker?" not "What's the role?"
- Example: Built Ambient.ai case study before on-site → showed $424K savings model → moved to final round

**When I'm the Hiring Manager:**
- Skip the "tell me about yourself" — waste of time
- Give real problems: "Here's our pipeline data, what's wrong?"
- Look for builders, not talkers
- Red flag: Someone who says "I'd hire more SDRs" (brute force)
- Green flag: Someone who says "First, let's see where the signal drops off" (systems thinking)

**What I Value:**
- Curiosity > Credentials
- Shipping > Planning
- Metrics > Narratives

**Deal Breaker:**
"That's not my job" mentality. In startups, everyone wears 3 hats.`

            response: `**How I Assess Company Fit**

**What I Look For:**
1. **Technical Respect** — Do they value engineering in GTM?
2. **Autonomy** — Can I build systems or just execute playbooks?
3. **Metrics** — Do they measure output or activity?
4. **Speed** — Do they ship fast or debate forever?

**Green Flags:**
- Founder/CEO is technical (understands what I'm building)
- Small team (< 50 people) — more impact, less politics
- Scrappy budget (forces creative solutions)
- "Show us what you'd build" vs. "Tell us about your experience"

**Red Flags:**
- "We need someone to manage our SDR team" (I don't babysit)
- "What's your Salesforce admin experience?" (I build, not configure)
- "Our process is very structured" (code for: slow and bureaucratic)

**Companies I'd Thrive At:**
- Series A/B SaaS (post-PMF, pre-bloat)
- Developer tools or cybersecurity (I speak the language)
- Founder-led sales → scaling motion
- Budget-conscious (my superpower: $0 stack)

**Deal Makers:**
Ambient.ai, BRM Labs, LiveRamp-type companies where GTM = competitive advantage.`

            response: `**My Problem-Solving Framework**

**Step 1: Define the Real Problem**
- Not "low pipeline" — that's a symptom
- Real problem: "Where in the funnel is signal dying?"
- Tool: Conversion rate audit at each stage

**Step 2: Identify the Constraint**
- Theory of Constraints: Fix the bottleneck first
- Example: If reply rate is 20% but meeting rate is 5%, problem is SDR qualification, not top-of-funnel

**Step 3: Build the Minimum Viable Fix**
- Don't build enterprise software
- Start with a Google Sheet + n8n workflow
- Ship in 48 hours, iterate weekly

**Step 4: Measure, Kill, or Scale**
- If it works: Automate it
- If it doesn't: Kill it fast
- No "let's give it more time" — data decides

**Example: Fudo Security Pipeline Stall**
- Symptom: 60-day sales cycles
- Root cause: AEs waiting for Security reviews
- Fix: Built a "Security Requirement Checklist" tool
- Result: Cut cycles to 35 days, +160% pipeline YoY

**The Principle:** Most problems aren't hard — they're just poorly defined.`

**I Don't Manage People — I Remove Obstacles**

**What Good Leaders Do:**
- Build systems so the team can self-serve
- Unblock faster than problems arise
- Ship tools, not directives

**What Bad Leaders Do:**
- Micromanage activity ("Did you make 50 calls?")
- Hoard context ("Just do what I say")
- Confuse busyness with productivity

**How I Run Teams:**
1. **Clarity > Control** — Give the "why," let them decide the "how"
2. **Tools > Training** — Build an AI co-pilot vs. 40-hour onboarding deck
3. **Metrics > Meetings** — Async dashboards, not daily standups

**Example:**
At Sense, I built an "Outreach Autopsy" tool that analyzed why cold emails failed. Team used it to self-diagnose issues. Result: Reply rates went from 8% → 15% in 6 weeks without me "managing" anyone.

**Bottom Line:** The best leaders make themselves unnecessary.`
