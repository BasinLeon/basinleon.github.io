# 🤝 BASIN::NEXUS COLLABORATION PROTOCOL

## How to Engage the GTM Orchestrator

This is an operational interface for hiring managers, founders, and collaborators. I do not do "ad-hoc" tasks; I deploy "Sovereign Systems."

### 1. ENGAGEMENT MODES

- **The Speculative Audit:** I perform a deep-dive logic audit of your current GTM engine and identify "Logic Gaps" where automation is leaking revenue.
- **Squad Design:** I architect a custom multi-agent squad (Builder/Tester/Auditor) for your specific tech stack.
- **Protocol Installation:** I install the BASIN::NEXUS governance rails (`.cursorrules`, `architecture.md`) into your existing repos to make your AI development "Safe for Production."

### 2. PREREQUISITES FOR WORK

Before an engagement begins, the following data points are required:

- **The Stack:** Current CRM, Enrichment tools, and Orchestration layer.
- **The Risk Level:** What is the blast radius? (e.g., "Internal tests only" vs "Live CEO outreach").
- **The Goal:** A specific, measurable engineering outcome (e.g., "Reduce SDR manual research time by 80%").

### 3. DELIVERABLES

Every project concludes with the following "institutional memory" artifacts:

- **The Architecture Doc:** A permanent record of the new system design.
- **The Rulebook:** Hard rails for future AI agents to follow.
- **The Logic Map:** A visualization of the Signal Refinery and Logic Gates.
