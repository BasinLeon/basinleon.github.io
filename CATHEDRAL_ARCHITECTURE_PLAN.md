# 🏛️ CATHEDRAL ARCHITECTURE PLAN
**Goal:** Transform landing page into a cathedral/museum where each room connects to top nav categories  
**Philosophy:** Hidden depth, never fully revealing, all tied to Basin::Nexus source

---

## 🎯 THE ULTIMATE GOAL

**Basin::Nexus is the source.** Everything connects back to it. Each room is a different experience, but they all share the same foundation.

**Navigation Categories = Cathedral Wings:**
- **Portfolio** = The Main Hall (Hero + Overview)
- **Blog** = The Chronicles Wing (Stories, insights, frameworks)
- **Tools** = The Laboratory Wing (Interactive systems)
- **GitHub** = The Archive Wing (Code, source, technical)
