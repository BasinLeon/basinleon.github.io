## THE ARCHITECT'S TRIAD

I don't just sell technology; I build it.

**15 years of GTM leadership** (Google, Fudo Security, SurveyMonkey, HP, NetApp) taught me Revenue Ops is broken. So I started coding my own agents.

Now I build **autonomous systems** that find leads, score signals, and craft outreach—while I sleep. This is the builder's path.

### THE THREE PILLARS

| Pillar | Core Capability | Proof Point |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **The Operator's Mind** | 15 years of process rigor (Google, NetApp, HP) applied to CRM/Sales systems | Reduced operational friction at scale |
| **The Ecosystem Builder** | I operationalize partner channels (US & LATAM) and turn "paper partners" into active revenue streams | 160% pipeline growth at Fudo |
| **The Strategist's Eye** | MBA-trained to create GTM narratives and pipeline architecture | Predictable, data-driven growth |
