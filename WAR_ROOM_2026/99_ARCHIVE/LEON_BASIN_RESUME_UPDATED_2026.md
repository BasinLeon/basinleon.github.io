## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I don't just sell technology—I build it. 15+ years of GTM leadership across Google, SurveyMonkey, HP, NetApp, and Series A cybersecurity companies taught me Revenue Ops is broken—so I started coding my own solutions.

**The Revenue Architect Who Codes:**
- **83,000+ lines of code** across Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Streamlit
- **19 public repositories** with live deployments
- **5 LLMs orchestrated** (Llama 3.3 70B, Mixtral 8x7B, Gemini Pro, GPT-4, Claude 3.5)
- **Built BASIN::NEXUS v10.0** — autonomous GTM Operating System that automates research, prioritization, and outreach

**The Architect Triad:**
- **Operator's Mind:** 15 years of process rigor (Google, NetApp, HP) applied to CRM/Sales systems that reduce friction
- **Ecosystem Builder:** Operationalize partner channels (US & LATAM) and turn "paper partners" into active revenue streams
- **Strategist's Eye:** MBA-trained to create GTM narratives and pipeline architecture that delivers predictable growth
