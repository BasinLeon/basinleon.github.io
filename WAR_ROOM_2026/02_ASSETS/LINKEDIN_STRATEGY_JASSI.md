# LINKEDIN & RESUME REFACTOR
## Objective: Remove "Confusion" for Jassi Singh
**Goal:** Present a linear, high-trajectory career path. Eliminate "multiple jumps."

---

### **1. THE NARRATIVE ARC**
Instead of "Consultant doing many things," the story becomes:
**"Big Tech Ops (Google) -> High-Growth Sales (Sense) -> Building GTM Systems (Basin/Fudo)."**

---

### **2. LINKEDIN CLEANUP (The "Delete" List)**
Jassi wants to see focus. We need to hide/remove the noise.

*   **REMOVE:** Any short term (<6 month) advisory roles listed as separate entries.
*   **REMOVE:** "Fractional" titles if they overlap too much.
*   **CONSOLIDATE:** Group all recent consulting/fractional work under ONE banner:
    *   **Role:** Principal GTM Architect
    *   **Company:** Basin & Associates
    *   **Dates:** Jan 2024 – Present
    *   **Description:** "Architecting revenue engines for Series A/B startups. Key projects: Fudo (Interim Head of Growth), SolveJet (GTM Strategy)."
    *   *Why: This turns 5 short stints into 1 long tenure.*

**Principal GTM Architect | Basin & Associates**
*Jan 2024 – Present*
*   Building autonomous revenue systems for high-growth startups.

#### **Previous Role:**
**Head of Growth (Interim) | Fudo**
*2023 – 2024*

### **4. THE HEADLINE**
**Old:** GTM Consultant | AI | Sales | Revenue
**New:** **Revenue Architect & GTM Systems Engineer**

---

### **5. ACTION PLAN FOR FRIDAY**
1.  **Update LinkedIn:** Consolidate the last 2 years into "Basin & Associates."
2.  **PDF Resume:** Generate a new PDF matching this simplified structure.
3.  **The "Talk Track" for Jassi:**
    *   "Jassi, you were right. My profile looked like a patchwork quilt. I've consolidated my consulting work to show the true story: I build systems. The 'jumps' were just different projects within my practice."
