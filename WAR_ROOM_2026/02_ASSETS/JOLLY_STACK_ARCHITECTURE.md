# 🦅 THE MODERN AGENTIC STACK (JOLLY DEPLOYMENT)

**Strategy:** Move "Basin::Nexus" from abstract theory to **Concrete Execution** using the "Jack Roberts" hyper-automation stack.

**Why this wins the job:**
Trevor Pang (GTM Engineer) and Zach Kirkhorn (CFO) don't want "experiments." They want a scalable, low-cost **Machine**. This stack proves you know the modern tools that cost pennies but deliver millions.

## 🏗️ THE ARCHITECTURE MAP

We define **Basin::Nexus** as an orchestration of these specific tools:

### 1. THE BRAIN (Logic & reasoning)
*   **Tool:** **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (via API) & **Google AI Studio**.
*   **Role:** The "SOP Engine." It doesn't just write emails; it decides *who* to email based on specific signals.
*   **Talking Point:** "I don't write scripts; I design cognitive workflows using Claude for reasoning and fast models for execution."

### 2. THE NERVOUS SYSTEM (Orchestration)
*   **Tool:** **n8n** (Self-hosted) or **Make** (Prototyping).
*   **Role:** The "Refinery." It connects the signals to the actions without brittle Python scripts.
*   **Talking Point:** "We use n8n for the 'Refinery' because it allows visual debugging of the GTM flow. If a signal fails, we see exactly where."

### 3. THE EYES (Signal Ingestion)
*   **Tool:** **Apify**.
*   **Role:** Scraping "Deviance" signals.
    *   *Example:* Monitor LinkedIn for "New VP of Sales" (Jolly target).
    *   *Example:* Monitor Job Boards for "Churning SDRs" (Signal of need).
*   **Talking Point:** "Apollo is static database. Apify is live intelligence. We scrape the 'moment of change'."

### 4. THE MEMORY (State & Context)
*   **Tool:** **Supabase** (Postgres Vector DB).
*   **Role:** Remembering every interaction.
    *   *Why:* To avoid "Spamming." If we messaged a prospect 6 months ago, Supabase remembers the context.
*   **Talking Point:** "The 'Invisible Ledger' lives in Supabase. It tracks not just deals, but 'Relationship Equity'."

### 5. THE HANDS (Action)
*   **Tool:** **Lindy AI** / **Cursor** (Code).
*   **Role:** Executing the final mile (Sending the email, Slack alert, or Jolly Point).

## 🎯 INTERVIEW TALK TRACK UPDATE

**Q: "What is your tech stack?"**

**OLD ANSWER:** "Python, HTML, CSS." (Too generic).

**NEW ANSWER (THE WINNER):**
"I build **Agentic Systems** using a specific 5-layer stack:
1.  **Ingestion:** **Apify** for live signal scraping (not just buying lists).
2.  **Orchestration:** **n8n** to visualize the logic flow (The "Refinery").
3.  **Intelligence:** **Claude/Gemini** to classify the signal (Is this high value?).
4.  **Memory:** **Supabase** for vector storage (The long-term ledger).
5.  **Coding:** **Cursor** to build custom UIs like the one I'm showing you today.
This keeps costs near zero but scales infinitely."

## ⚡ ACTION ITEM
I will update the `JOLLY_NEXUS_DEMO.html` to visualize this stack in the **"KERNEL"** tab. This will make your demo look 10x more realizable.
