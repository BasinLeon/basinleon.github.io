# RECRUITER TRANSLATION LAYER (TALK TRACKS)

## The "What are you?" Question
**Recruiter:** "Are you looking for a Sales role or a technical role?"
**Leon:** "I am looking for a **GTM Leadership** role where I can deploy technical systems. Most companies use manual labor to find leads; I use 'Signal Refineries'—automated Python stacks—to find them 10x faster. I'm a Sales Leader who builds his own leverage."

### 3. THE "TITLE vs. MANDATE" PIVOT (For Fudo)
- **Recruiter Question:** "I see you were a Senior Manager/BDM at Fudo, but you talk like an Engineer?"
- **The Answer:** "Exactly. My official title was GTM Strategy Lead/Sr. BDM, but my *mandate* was Revenue Architecture. I didn't reach 4.6x growth by making more calls; I reached it by coding the 'Signal Refinery' systems that eliminated the manual toil. I'm seeking a Director role now to bring that same engineering mindset to a larger scale."
- **Key Frame:** Title = BDM. Results = Director.

### 5. THE "QUOTA vs. INFRASTRUCTURE" PIVOT (The Final Move)
- **Recruiter Question:** "Most of your background is in Sales (BDM/Manager). Why the shift to GTM Engineering?"
- **The Answer:** "I’ve spent 15 years carrying a number, and I realized that most sales failures aren't due to poor people—they're due to poor systems. I found myself spending 40% of my time coding Python scrapers and automated workflows just to make my number predictable. I’m moving into GTM Engineering because my highest value to a company isn't 'closing'—it's building the stable infrastructure that ensures every salesperson in the building hits their number."
- **Key Frame:** I'm moving from 'Mercenary' (carrying a number) to 'Architect' (building the machine).

## The "Titles" Translation
- **GTM Engineer** = "Sales Operations & Automation Leader"
- **Revenue Architect** = "Head of Growth Strategy"
- **Basin::Nexus** = "Proprietary Lead-Gen Infrastructure"
