# 🦅 LINKEDIN SURGERY: THE "REVENUE ARCHITECT" CLEANUP

> **Objective:** Eliminate "Confusing" history. Signal "Senior Architect," not "Generalist Sales."
> **Immediate Action Required:** Open LinkedIn -> Edit Profile.

---

## 1. THE "CONFUSION" REMOVAL (Hide These Roles)
*Reasons: These roles dilute the "Engineer" narrative and make the career look "jumpy" or less specialized.*

*   ❌ **SlingShot Connections (6 mos):** Hide. (Staffing focus distracts from SaaS GTM).
*   ❌ **Sanho Corporation (4 yrs 1 mo):** Hide. (Customer Success is relevant, but "Hardware/Retail" vibes hurt the "SaaS Architect" story).
*   ❌ **Mosaic Sales Solutions (2 yrs):** Hide. (Retail/merchandising role. Not relevant to Director-level GTM).
*   ❌ **PropertyMinder (7 mos):** Hide. (Junior SDR role. You have 15 years exp, you don't need to show Entry Level anymore).
*   ⚠️ **Hewlett Packard (1 yr 6 mos):** *Optional Hide.* If this was retail demo management, hide it. If it was corporate field sales, keep it. Recommendation: **Hide** to keep the focus on Google/NetApp/SaaS.

## 2. THE "NARRATIVE" REFRAME (Update These Roles)

### 🟢 Current Role: Basin::Nexus (Independent Consultancy)
*Problem: Sounds like you are a "Founder" actively growing a business (hiring employees, etc).*
*Fix: Frame it as "Senior Consultant" holding pattern.*

*   **Title:** Principal GTM Architect (Fractional)
*   **Employment Type:** Contract
*   **Description Update (Top Line):**
    > "Deploying fractional revenue architecture for Series A clients while seeking a full-time Director of GTM Systems / Revenue Engineering role. I build the systems so you don't have to hire the headcount."

### 🟢 The "Founder" Confusion
*   **Headline:** Change "I'm building Signal Refineries..." to:
    > **Revenue Architect & GTM Systems Engineer | Python, AI & RevOps Automation | Open to Director Roles**
*   **About Section:** Add a clear footer:
    > *Currently deploying these systems as a consultant, but looking for a permanent home to build the engine in-house.*

---

## 3. THE "GOLDEN ERA" (Keep These Visible)
*These roles prove the "Enterprise + Startup" hybrid value.*

*   ✅ **Fudo Security:** (Shows "Head of GTM" capability).
*   ✅ **Braintrust:** (Shows Web3/Community/Growth modernization).
*   ✅ **Sense:** (Shows "Group Manager" leadership + SaaS).
*   ✅ **SurveyMonkey:** (Shows "Enterprise" rigour).
*   ✅ **Google:** (Shows "Operations" DNA).
*   ✅ **NetApp:** (Shows "Systems/Ops" foundation).

## 4. EXECUTION CHECKLIST
1.  [ ] **Go to Experience Section.**
2.  [ ] Click the Pencil icon ✏️ next to SlingShot, Sanho, Mosaic, PropertyMinder.
3.  [ ] **Delete** (or if offering "Hide" option, select that, but usually Delete is cleaner for old roles).
4.  [ ] **Edit "Basin::Nexus"** Title to "Lead GTM Consultant (Fractional)".
5.  [ ] **Save.**
6.  [ ] **Check "Open To Work" settings:** Ensure "Job Titles" includes "GTM Engineer", "Revenue Operations Director", "Sales Operations Director".

---
*Once this cleanup is done, the profile will read: NetApp -> Google -> SurveyMonkey -> Sense -> Fudo -> Architect. This is a clean, ascending line of Systems & Revenue logic.*
