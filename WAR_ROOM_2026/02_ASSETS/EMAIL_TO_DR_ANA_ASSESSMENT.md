Subject: Assessment Figures for Today's Meeting - Leon Basin

Hi Dr. Ana,

Attached are the figures for the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 assessments we discussed. I've filled them out digitally as my printer is currently unavailable.

Summary of Scores:
- GAD-7 Total: 12 (Moderate)
- PHQ-9 Total: 4 (Minimal)

I've also included some brief context on my current focus regarding business monetization, spiritual alignment, and GTM architecture, as these are driving my current state of "high-speed" activity.

Looking forward to our meeting at 2:00 PM.

Best,
Leon
