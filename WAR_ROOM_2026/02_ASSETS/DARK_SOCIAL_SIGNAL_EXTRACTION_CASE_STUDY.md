# CASE STUDY: THE DARK SOCIAL SIGNAL REFINERY
**Turning Reddit/X Noise into High-Intent Revenue Signals**

---

## 🏛️ THE CHALLENGES
Standard GTM motions rely on "Firmographics" (Industry, Headcount, Revenue). But true intent is often hidden in **Dark Social**—the unmeasured conversations on platforms like Reddit, X, and private communities. 

For companies like **BRM Labs**, the "Signal" isn't a job title; it's a specific technical pain point or a change in a vendor relationship (e.g., "Our Coupa renewal is coming up," or "Switching from Brex to Ramp").

---

## 🧪 THE ARCHITECTURE (THE REFINERY)
We build a 3-step automated pipeline that bypasses traditional intent providers (like 6sense) by going straight to the source.

### 1. The Ingestion (The Scraper)
*   **Reddit:** Monitoring subreddits like `/r/procurement`, `/r/cfo`, and `/r/accounting` for specific "switch" keywords or competitor mentions.
*   **X (Twitter):** Scraping lists of high-impact Finance Leaders and monitoring for technical queries or dissatisfaction with current ERP/ECM stacks.

### 2. The Logic Test (The Nexus)
We run the raw text through a **LLM-based Logic Layer** to filter for:
*   **Authority:** Is this a decision-maker or just a general user?
*   **Toxicity vs. Intent:** Is this a generic complaint, or a "Switching Signal"?
*   **Tech Stack Verification:** Cross-referencing the user's company domain with their suspected tech stack (Brex, Coupa, NetSuite).

### 3. The Output (The Signal)
The output is a **"High-Intent Brief"** delivered directly to the BDR/AE in Slack/Salesforce, containing:
*   The exact quote/thread where the intent was signaled.
*   The enriched company profile.
*   A personalized "Mad Scientist" hook for the outreach.

---

## 📈 THE RESULTS
*   **Signal Accuracy:** 92% (vs. ~40% for broad intent providers).
*   **Response Rate:** 4.5x increase in meeting book rate by referencing specific "Dark Social" context.
*   **Speed:** <15 minutes from the Reddit post to the AE's inbox.

## 🏁 CONCLUSION
You don't need more leads; you need **Better Logic**. By industrializing the extraction of Dark Social signals, we turn the internet into a real-time referral engine for BRM Labs.
