**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Leon Basin
**Use Case:** Pre-meeting audit to show value before the call

## 🎯 PURPOSE

This template allows you to run a **speculative GTM audit** on any company BEFORE you meet with them. You arrive to the call with insights, not questions. This positions you as an architect, not a vendor.

## SECTION 1: COMPANY SNAPSHOT

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Company** | [Company Name] |
| **Website** | [URL] |
| **Stage** | Seed / Series A / Series B |
| **Industry** | [B2B SaaS / AI/ML / Cybersecurity / etc.] |

## SECTION 2: SIGNAL LEAK DETECTION

### 2.1 Inbound Motion Analysis

| Question | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| Do they have a lead capture form? | Yes / No |
| What happens after form submission? | [Generic thank you / Demo scheduling / Nothing] |
| Is there any enrichment happening? | [Visible signals of personalization?] |
| Time-to-response estimate | [Immediate / Hours / Days] |

**Signal Leak Diagnosis:**
> [Describe the gap. Example: "Form submissions go to a generic inbox. No enrichment. Estimated 48-hour response time. Whales decay."]

### 2.2 Outbound Motion Analysis

| Question | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| Do they have SDRs on LinkedIn? | Yes (count: X) / No |
| Are they using sales engagement tools? | [Outreach / Salesloft / Apollo / Unknown] |
| Quality of LinkedIn messaging | [Templated / Personalized / N/A] |
| Content signal (blog, podcast, etc.) | [Active / Sparse / None] |

**Outbound Diagnosis:**
> [Describe the gap. Example: "2 SDRs on LinkedIn sending templated messages. No visible content engine. Outbound is spray-and-pray."]
