# LINKEDIN PROFILE OPTIMIZATION
**Objective:** Rebrand from "GTM Consultant" (Generalist) to "Revenue Architect" (Specialist/Builder).

---

## 1. THE HEADLINE
**Current:** Principal GTM Consultant @ Independent Consultant | Client Relations, Revenue Operations
**Critique:** "Client Relations" implies support. "Independent" implies looking.
**New (The "Architect" Frame):**

> **Director of GTM Systems | Revenue Architect | Building Autonomous GTM Engines (Python/AI) | Ex-Google**

*Why this works: It highlights "Systems" and "Building" over "Operations". It flags "Python/AI" to show technical depth.*

---

## 2. THE EXPERIENCE
**Current Title:** GTM Consultant
**New Title:** **Revenue Architect & GTM Engineer**

**Description:**
"Architecting automated revenue engines for high-growth startups. I build the systems that replace manual SDR toil with code."

*   **The Architecture:** Designer of 'Basin::Nexus', a Python-based signal refinery that eliminates the '48-Hour Void' in lead response time.
*   **The Stack:** Orchestrating autonomous GTM logic via Python, n8n, Clay, and LLMs to detect 'Whales' and trigger instant executive alerts.
*   **The Impact:** Helped partners capture **$1.8M in New Yield** and **160% Pipeline Growth** by shifting from 'Headcount-based' to 'Signal-based' prospecting.

## 3. THE "ABOUT" SUMMARY
(Optional Refresh to align with the "Stop Hiring SDRs" thesis)

"I don't just run operations; I build revenue architectures.
With 10+ years at Google, NetApp, and SurveyMonkey, I learned that modern GTM problems aren't solved by hiring more bodies—they are solved by better code.

Today, I operate as a **Revenue Architect**, deploying 'Basin::Nexus' to help companies automate signal detection, enrich leads instantly, and route 'Whales' to executives in <400ms.

My Core Stack: Python | n8n | SQL | AI Agents"

## 4. THE FEATURED SECTION (Critical)
**Strategy:** Use this section to prove your "Builder" status. Do not leave it empty or filled with generic resume PDFs.

**Slot 1 (The Hook):**
*   **Media:** Link to your LinkedIn Post / Loom Video.
*   **Title:** "Watch me build a Lead Signal Refinery in 60 Seconds"
*   **Description:** "A live build log showing how to detect 'Whales' and alert executives in 400ms using Python & n8n."

**Slot 2 (The Blueprint):**
*   **Media:** Upload `GTM_Signal_Refinery_Executive_White_Paper.pdf` (Export the MD to PDF).
*   **Title:** "GTM Signal Refinery: Executive Brief"
*   **Description:** "The exact architecture I use to replace manual SDR work with automated signal processing."
