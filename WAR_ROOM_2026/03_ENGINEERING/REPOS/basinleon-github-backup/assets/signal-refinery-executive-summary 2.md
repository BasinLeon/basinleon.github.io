Here's the Architecture Brief I mentioned.

It covers:
• The 48-Hour Void — Why manual signal routing is killing your speed-to-lead
• The Signal Refinery — My Python-native approach to filtering noise at 0.8 precision
• The Proof — 160% pipeline growth, $1.8M yield

Let me know if any of the architecture maps to problems you're seeing on your side.

```
Killing "Human Latency" in GTM — An Architecture Brief

Most teams solve pipeline problems by adding headcount.
I solved it by building infrastructure.

This 4-page brief covers:
→ The 48-Hour Void (where deals die)
→ The Signal Refinery (Python/LLM precision gates)
→ The Proof (160% growth, $1.8M yield)

## CEO/VP DM Follow-ups

### After a CEO Downloads the PDF

```
Appreciate you grabbing the brief.

Quick context: The "Refinery" logic started as a side project to solve a real problem I was seeing—SDR teams burning cycles on stale signals while hot leads went cold.

If this maps to anything you're seeing on your GTM side, happy to walk through the architecture in 15 minutes. No pitch—just the technical breakdown.

### After a VP of Sales Downloads the PDF

```
Thanks for the download.

The 160% growth came from one shift: stop measuring "activity" (calls, emails) and start measuring "signal quality" (precision, latency).

If your team is dealing with similar friction—signals piling up, reps chasing stale leads—I can show you the Python logic behind the gates.

Worth a 15-minute call?

### After a CRO Downloads the PDF

```
Thanks for grabbing this.

The core thesis: Your SDR team isn't slow because they're bad. They're slow because they're running 2026 pipeline on 2015 infrastructure.

The "Refinery" is my answer to that. If you're evaluating how to scale GTM without linear headcount growth, I'd be happy to map the architecture to your current stack.
