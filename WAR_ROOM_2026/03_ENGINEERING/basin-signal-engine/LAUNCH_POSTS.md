## BASIN::NEXUS ONLINE // 8,297 lines deployed

**I don't just sell technology.**
**I build AI agents.**

15 years GTM leadership. Google, NetApp, HP, Fudo Security, SurveyMonkey.
Now I code autonomous systems that find leads, score signals, and close while I sleep.

═══════════════════════════════════════════

**THE STATS:**

→ **160%** Pipeline Growth
→ **$2M+** Net New Pipeline
→ **5** LLMs Orchestrated
→ **8,297** Lines of Python
→ **18** Production Modules

═══════════════════════════════════════════

**WHY I BUILT THIS:**

Traditional job searching is broken:
• Linear (Apply → Wait → Reject)
• Reactive (chasing postings)
• Unmeasured (no pipeline metrics)

So I engineered a solution.

**BASIN::NEXUS** is a full-stack Career Intelligence Platform that treats job searching like Enterprise GTM.

**THE ARCHITECTURE:**

**📡 ORACLE ARRAY** (Discovery & Intel)
→ 7-vector job sweep: LinkedIn, ATS, VC portfolios, Twitter, Reddit, HN, financial news
→ Predictive signal detection before roles go live
→ Hidden job market scanning

**⚔️ BATTLESTATION** (Simulation & Prep)
→ Boardroom Simulator: CEO, CFO, VP, Partnership interviews
→ Voice Telemetry: WPM, filler words, presence scoring
→ Digital Twin Protocol: Pre-call prep, objection triggers, post-call analytics
→ Technical BS Detector: Scores outreach for credibility

**🏗️ BUILDER DECK** (Execution & Closing)
→ Pipeline CRM with stage probability
→ Compensation negotiation scripts
→ First-90-day plan generator
→ G-Suite integration for live data

💡 **FOR HIRING MANAGERS:** This isn't a side project. It's a working system I built to run my own job search. 8,297 lines. 5 LLMs. Zero templates.

💼 **FOR RECRUITERS:** I'm seeking Director/VP-level GTM, RevOps, or GTM Engineering roles where I can build systems—not just run playbooks.

BASIN::NEXUS ONLINE // 8,297 lines deployed

I don't just sell technology.
I build AI agents.

15 years GTM. Now I code systems that find leads and close while I sleep.

Here's what I built 🧵

---

**2/9:**
The problem with job searching:

→ Linear (Apply → Wait → Reject)
→ Reactive (chasing postings)
→ Unmeasured (no pipeline metrics)

I treated it like an engineering problem.

---

**3/9:**
📡 THE ORACLE ARRAY

7-vector job sweep:
• LinkedIn, ATS, VC portfolios
• Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News
• Financial news signals

I know WHO is hiring before the req goes live.

---

**4/9:**
⚔️ THE BATTLESTATION

• Boardroom Simulator (CEO, CFO, VP interviews)
• Voice Telemetry (WPM, fillers, presence)
• Digital Twin Protocol (pre-call prep)
• Technical BS Detector (credibility scoring)

Practice until it's muscle memory.

---

**5/9:**
🏗️ THE BUILDER DECK

• Pipeline CRM with stage probability
• Compensation negotiation scripts
• First-90-day plan generator
• G-Suite integration

If I'm treating job search like a deal, I'm tracking it like one.

---

**6/9:**
THE STACK:

• Python + Streamlit
• Llama 3.3 70B, Mixtral, Gemini, Claude
• Whisper for voice
• Langchain for orchestration

8,297 lines. 18 modules. Deployed live.

**7/9:**
THE CAREER:

• Google (Wallet ops)
• NetApp (Enterprise storage)
• HP (Field sales, team of 20)
• SurveyMonkey (Enterprise BD)
• Sense (Global BD, AI recruitment)
• Fudo Security ($2M+ pipeline)

15 years of GTM → Now I code it.

---

**8/9:**
I generated $2M+ in net new pipeline at Fudo Security.

I built a boutique GTM consultancy for early-stage startups.

I spoke at RSA Conference 2024 and 2025.

But the most important thing I built is BASIN::NEXUS.

---

**9/9:**
Why share this?

Because I'm not looking for a job.

I'm looking for a team that values:
→ Systems over spreadsheets
→ Architecture over activity
→ Builders over talkers

DM me if that's you.

# 📧 COLD OUTREACH EMAIL

**Subject:** I built something that proves how I think

---

Hi [Name],

I've been following [Company]'s growth — particularly [specific observation].

Rather than send you a traditional resume, I want to share something more revealing.

While in career transition, I built **BASIN::NEXUS** — a full-stack Career Intelligence Platform. 8,297 lines of Python. 5 LLMs orchestrated. Deployed live.

It treats job searching like Enterprise GTM:
• An Oracle for predictive market signals
• A Dojo for AI-powered interview simulation with voice telemetry
• A CRM for pipeline tracking with stage probability

**Why does this matter for [Company]?**

Because when I see a broken process, I don't wait for someone to fix it.
I engineer a solution and ship it.

That's the same approach that generated $2M+ in pipeline at Fudo Security.
That's what I'll bring to your [GTM/RevOps] challenge.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

# 🎙️ 60-SECOND INTERVIEW INTRO

"Thanks for taking the time. Let me give you context on how I think.

I have 15 years in GTM — Google, NetApp, HP, SurveyMonkey, Sense, Fudo Security.

At Fudo, I generated $2M+ in net new pipeline, spoke at RSA Conference twice, and built outbound systems from scratch.

But the most telling thing about me is what I built during my career transition:

BASIN::NEXUS — a full-stack Career Intelligence Platform. 8,297 lines of Python. 5 LLMs orchestrated. Voice telemetry. Pipeline CRM.

I treated my job search like an enterprise sales cycle.

Because that's how I think:

- See a broken process
- Engineer a solution
- Ship it

That's the energy I bring to GTM. Not just running playbooks — building the infrastructure that makes revenue repeatable.

Should I walk you through the system, or would you prefer to dive into the role?"

# 📱 RECRUITER DM

Rather than a resume, here's proof of how I operate:

**BASIN::NEXUS** — 8,297 lines of Python

I built my own Career OS while in transition.

That's the same systems-thinking that generated $2M+ at Fudo Security.

Worth a conversation?
