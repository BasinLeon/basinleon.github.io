## 🧬 THE ARCHITECT'S NARRATIVE

I don't just sell technology; I build it.

15 years of GTM leadership (Google, Fudo Security, SurveyMonkey, HP, NetApp) taught me Revenue Ops is broken. So I started coding my own agents.

Now I build autonomous systems that find leads, score signals, and craft outreach—while I sleep. This is the builder's path.

### THE ARCHITECT TRIAD
