## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I don't just sell technology; I build it. 15+ years of GTM leadership across Google, Fudo Security, SurveyMonkey, and enterprise tech taught me Revenue Ops is broken—so I started coding my own solutions.

**The Architect Triad:**

- **Operator's Mind:** 15 years of process rigor applied to CRM/Sales systems
- **Ecosystem Builder:** Operationalize partner channels and turn dormant partners into revenue streams
- **Strategist's Eye:** MBA-trained to create GTM narratives and pipeline architecture
