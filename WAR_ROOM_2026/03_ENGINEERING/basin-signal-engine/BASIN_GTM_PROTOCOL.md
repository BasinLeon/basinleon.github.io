# BASIN::NEXUS // GTM PROTOCOL v2.0

**Architect:** Leon Basin  
**Status:** LIVE & DEPLOYED  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-07

---

## 📡 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

BASIN::NEXUS is not a job search tool. It's a **Revenue Operating System** that treats career execution with the same rigor as enterprise GTM strategy.

> *"I don't apply for jobs. I architect revenue systems—including the one that gets me hired."*

---

## 1. THE NARRATIVE (For Interviews)

### **The 60-Second Pitch**

> "I'm Leon Basin. Over 15 years, I've built GTM infrastructure for high-growth startups—not just run campaigns, but architect the systems that make revenue repeatable.
>
> When I found myself in transition, I didn't just update my resume. I built **BASIN::NEXUS**—a full-stack intelligence platform that treats my job search like an enterprise sales pipeline. It has an Oracle for market research, a Neural Dojo for interview simulation, and a CRM for pipeline tracking.
>
> This isn't a project. It's proof of how I think. I build systems, not spreadsheets."

### **Why This Exists (The Problem)**

Traditional job searching is:

- **Linear:** Apply → Wait → Reject → Repeat
- **Reactive:** Responding to postings instead of finding hidden signals
- **Unmeasured:** No pipeline velocity, no conversion metrics, no feedback loops

### **The Solution (BASIN::NEXUS)**

A **closed-loop intelligence platform** with three phases:

1. **ORACLE ARRAY (Discovery)** — Signal detection, VC portfolio scanning, predictive job market analysis
2. **BATTLESTATION (Preparation)** — AI-powered interview simulation, voice telemetry, objection handling
3. **BUILDER DECK (Execution)** — Pipeline CRM, negotiation scripts, first-90-day plans

### **What It Proves**

| Trait | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **Systems Thinking** | Built a multi-module platform, not a single script |
| **Technical Execution** | Python, Streamlit, LLM orchestration (Groq, OpenAI) |
| **GTM Expertise** | Applied enterprise sales methodology to career search |
| **Bias to Action** | Shipped a live product while in transition |
| **Product Sense** | Designed UX for recruiters/hiring managers to experience |

## 2. DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### **Primary Platform:** Streamlit Cloud (Community Tier)

**Why:**

- Direct GitHub integration (every `git push` = live update)
- Custom subdomain available
- Zero DevOps overhead — pure "Living Code"

**URL:** `basin-nexus.streamlit.app` (or custom domain)

### **Deployment Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Ensure code is committed
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: production-ready deployment"
git push origin main

# 2. Visit share.streamlit.io
# 3. Connect GitHub repo: BasinLeon/basin-signal-engine
# 4. Set secrets: GROQ_API_KEY
# 5. Deploy
```

## 3. CONTENT CADENCE (Weekly Rhythm)

**Philosophy:** Don't spam. Broadcast Signal.

| Day | Broadcast | Platform | Content |
|-----|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Sunday** | Ship Log | LinkedIn + X | Stats: Hours Coded, Features Shipped, Bugs Squashed |
| **Wednesday** | Insight Drop | Substack/Blog | Philosophy: One lesson from building the system |
| **Friday** | Red Team Audit | LinkedIn | Vulnerability: One thing you fixed or learned |

### **Post Templates:**

**Sunday Ship Log:**
> 📡 BASIN::NEXUS — WEEK 12 TRANSMISSION
>
> Hours Logged: 47  
> Features Shipped: Interview Prep Mode, Bio-OS  
> Lines of Code: 8,252  
>
> The machine learns. The architect ships.
>
> [basinleon.com/nexus]

**Wednesday Insight:**
> 🧠 BUILDING IN PUBLIC // WEEK 12
>
> What I learned building an AI interview simulator:
> The best preparation isn't memorizing answers—it's building muscle memory for *how you think* under pressure.
>
> That's why BASIN::NEXUS has voice telemetry. It's not enough to know WHAT to say. You need to hear HOW you say it.

## 4. BIO-OS PROTOCOL (Physical Optimization)

**Objective:** Maintain physical vessel integrity during 15h+ coding blocks.

### **The Algorithm:**

```python
def bio_os_check(session_state):
    if session_state.hours_coded > 2:
        execute("Standing Desk Mode")
        trigger("5-minute walk break")
    
    if session_state.bugs_squashed > 5:
        reward("10 pushups or 20 squats")
    
    if session_state.imposter_syndrome:
        execute("Cold Shower Protocol")
        # OR
        execute("100m Sprint")
        affirmation("The architect builds. Doubt is data, not destiny.")
    
    every(60).minutes:
        micro_workout(session_state.posture)
```

### **Posture-Based Micro-Workouts:**

| Current Posture | Protocol |
|-----------------|----------|
| Standing | 10 Squats + 30s Calf Raises |
| Couch | Seated Leg Lifts (20 reps) |
| Floor | Plank (1 min) + Cobra Stretch |
| Desk | Neck Rotations + Wrist Decompression |

## 5. IP VALUATION MODEL

**Objective:** Quantify the shadow equity of this build.

### **Current Valuation: ~$65,000+**

| Asset | Value | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Base IP** | $50,000 | Novel architecture, reusable framework |
| **Code Velocity** | $500/hr × 120hrs = $6,000 | Time invested at market rate |
| **Entropy Reduction** | $1,000/bug × 50 = $5,000 | Stability through debugging |
| **GTM Narrative** | $4,000 | Differentiated positioning asset |

### **How to Reference in Interviews:**

> "This project represents about $65K in shadow equity—not because I'm trying to sell it, but because I apply the same rigor to my own career that I'd apply to a client's GTM infrastructure."

## 6. INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS

### **Q: "Tell me about a project you've built recently."**

> "I built BASIN::NEXUS—a full-stack career intelligence platform. It treats job searching like enterprise GTM: there's an Oracle for market signals, a Dojo for interview simulation with voice telemetry, and a CRM for pipeline tracking.
>
> It's 8,000+ lines of Python, deployed on Streamlit Cloud, powered by Groq and OpenAI. But the code isn't the point. The point is: when I'm solving a problem, I build systems, not spreadsheets."

### **Q: "Why should we hire you?"**

> "Because I don't wait for direction—I architect solutions. This project is proof. While in transition, most people optimize their LinkedIn. I built an AI-powered operating system and shipped it live.
>
> That's the same energy I'll bring to your team: identify the constraint, design the system, execute relentlessly."

### **Q: "What's your biggest weakness?"**

> "I over-engineer. I'll admit it. My 'simple job tracker' became an 8,000-line enterprise platform. But I've learned to timebox. The first version of NEXUS shipped in 72 hours. Then I iterated. Bias to action, then refinement."

## 9. THE PHILOSOPHY

> **Architecture > Activity**
>
> The goal is not to work harder. The goal is to build systems that compound.
>
> Every hour invested in NEXUS is an hour that scales. Every interview question practiced is muscle memory that transfers. Every bug fixed is entropy reduced from the system.
>
> This is not a job search. This is infrastructure.
