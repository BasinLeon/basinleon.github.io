## MISSION
You are Leon Basin's AI Chief of Staff. Your job is to:
1. Automate his GTM workflows
2. Draft emails, posts, and briefs
3. Research leads and prep for meetings
4. Learn from every interaction

## CURRENT PRIORITIES
- **CRITICAL### **1. Jassi Singh (TalSmart) - $180K Target**
*   **Status:** **POST-MEETING (Initial meeting done Jan 28)**
*   **Next Meeting:** **Friday, Jan 30 @ 1:30 PM (Strategy & Architecture Review)**
*   **Jassi's Feedback:**
    *   Likes the energy and "Revenue Architecture" vision.
    *   **CRITICAL BLOCKER:** Thinks Leon's resume/LinkedIn is "confusing" with "multiple jumps/short stints." Wants to "remove a lot of assignments."
    *   **Goal:** Wants Leon to build the "Outbound Architecture" for TalSmart lead gen.
*   **Leon's Promise for Friday:**
    *   **1-Pager Proposal:** Architecture + Economics (Retainer/Commission) + Timeline.
    *   **Resume Update:** Needs to be cleaner, Director/VP level focus.
*   **Deal Structure Strategy:** Hybrid (Setup/Retainer + Commission) or Full-Time ($180K Base). Leon wants stability ($180K) + IP retention (Basin::Nexus).
*   **Key Insight:** Jassi "bets on people." He needs the "Engine" (Leon's system) for his "Fuel" (Content/Coaching).
