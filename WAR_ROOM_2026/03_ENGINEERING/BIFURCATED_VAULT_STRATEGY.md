# 🦅 THE BIFURCATED VAULT: PUBLIC SIGNAL vs. PRIVATE TRUTH

> **Core Philosophy:** "The world sees the Architecture; only you (and I) see the Engine."
> **Mission:** Serving Hashem through excellence and integrity. We reveal the "What" to build authority, but we keep the "How" (the proprietary logic) in your local vault.

## 1. THE REPO STRATEGY (The Split)

### 📂 PUBLIC: THE FOUNDRY (GitHub)
*   **Purpose:** The "Museum of Proof." It built authority and attracts deals.
*   **What goes here:**
    1.  **Interface Files:** Like your `NEXUS_LIVE_DASHBOARD.html`.
    2.  **Logic Frameworks:** Markdown files explaining the *theory* of GTM Engineering.
    3.  **Skeleton Scripts:** Python scripts with the "Secret Sauce" stripped out or replaced with `[LOCAL_LOGIC]`.
    4.  **Case Studies:** The "War Stories" (Challenger, etc.).

### 📂 PRIVATE: THE VAULT (Local Machine)
*   **Purpose:** The "Engine of Revenue." This is where the real code lives.
*   **What goes here:**
    1.  **API Keys:** Never leave your machine.
    2.  **Proprietary Algorithms:** Your specific lead scoring and signal refinery logic.
    3.  **Real Data:** The leads, CRM exports, and partnership details.
    4.  **Local Database:** Your unified history of every deal and connection.

## 2. THE TECH STACK (Resources Needed)

### 🟢 LOCAL AUTONOMY TOOLS
*   **Python 3.12+ (Local):** Your primary building language.
*   **Ollama (Local LLM):** To process private data (leads, emails) using models like Llama 3 or DeepSeek without sending them to any cloud provider.
*   **n8n Desktop (Local Automation):** To connect strings together without paying for Zapier or revealing your workflows.
*   **PostgreSQL (Local DB):** A real database to store your "Nexus Network" history.
*   **Git (Local-only):** You initialize a git repo locally that *never* pushes to GitHub for the core code.

## 3. HOW WE BUILD "BIT & PIECES" (The GitHub Teaser)

When we finish a tool like the `unified_ingestor.py`, we do this:
1.  **Copy** the script to a "Public" folder.
2.  **Redact** the specific signal filters and target subreddits.
3.  **Replace** with `SIGNALS = [ "Signal A", "Signal B" ]`.
4.  **Upload** to GitHub with a README: *"This is a framework for signal ingestion. The logic layer is proprietary."*

## 4. SERVING HASHEM: INTEGRITY IN CODE
*   **Truth (Emet):** Our systems must report real data, not numbers intended to please humans.
*   **Peace (Shalom):** Our automation serves to reduce stress and chaos, not add noise to the world.
*   **Hard Work (Avodah):** We build the hard way (engineering) to provide value that doesn't exist elsewhere.

> **Current Status:** We have the Vault (this computer). We have the Foundry (GitHub). I will ensure every file I write for you is clearly labeled as **[INTERNAL]** or **[PUBLIC-READY]**.
