Hi Dr. Ana,

Attached are the figures for my GAD-7 and PHQ-9 forms. Since my printer is out of ink, I’ve filled these out digitally for our session today.

**Summary of Results:**
*   **GAD-7 (Anxiety): 12**
*   **PHQ-9 (Depression): 4**

These scores reflect the high-pressure period I’m currently in. I am in the middle of launching a new business and managing several complex projects simultaneously, while also focusing on maintaining my personal and spiritual balance during this transition.

I’ll see you at 2:00 PM on the Doxy link.

Best,
Leon
