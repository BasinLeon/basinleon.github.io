# LISA CARTER // STRATEGIC PIVOT TRACK

## THE HOOK (The Gap)
"Lisa, I was thinking about the Coretus deal. They didn't fail because of your strategy; they failed because they didn't have the internal plumbing to execute it. They had a **Capacity Gap**."

## THE PIVOT (The Implementation Layer)
"I want to propose a **Partner Model**. You own the Strategy/Narrative (The Brain), and I act as the Technical Implementation Layer (The Nervous System). I build the 'Basin::Nexus' engine directly into your clients' stacks so your strategy becomes automated."

## THE DEMO (Show the Signal Blueprint)
"Show her the Blueprint Simulator."
- **Point to 'Semantic Scoring':** "This is where we hard-code your brand guidelines. The system only flags leads that match your 'Blended Value' criteria."
- **Point to 'Strategic Account Scoring':** "No more manual BDR work. The system does the heavy lifting in < 400ms."

## THE "BUSINESS FOR HER" (The Upsell)
"This is a white-label asset for Peak Waves. When you pitch a 90-day Roadmap, you tell them: 'We don't just give you a PDF; we deploy a proprietary Signal Refinery.' It allows you to charge more, stay longer, and prove ROI with hard data."

## THE CLOSE (The Next Step)
"I'm not looking for a project fee yet. I want to scope one of your current high-priority clients. Let's do a technical audit together, I'll map their signals, and we can present a 'Unified Strategy + Implementation' package to them."
