Hi Ellen,

Looking forward to our 6pm. I wanted to send a quick context dump so we can maximize our hour.

A lot has shifted. I’ve moved away from the "SDR" identity and into a Revenue Architect role. I’m now building automated GTM systems (Basin::Nexus) that use AI agents to replace manual sales motions.

Two big updates for us to discuss:
1. The Ambient.ai Play: I just finished an intensive "Architect" evaluation with them. It shifted my "floor" for what I’m capable of building.
2. The TalSmart Deal: I’m in a live pilot negotiation with a $55M-exit Chairman. I have a technical demo tomorrow at 1 PM CST for a $5,000/mo retainer. I will be demonstrating how I've automated his exact sales philosophy into a "Digital Sam" agent.

The Evidence (Trajectory Shift):
I’m no longer just "writing emails"; I’m building infrastructure. You can see the shift in my recent work here:
- The Documentation: Basin::Nexus | Whale Alert System
- The Philosophy: I Built a Whale Detector in 3 Hours (Substack)

The Goal for Today: 
I need your help to ground my executive voice. I’m moving from "Mercenary for hire" back to "Founder/Builder." I specifically want to talk about how to frame my recent short stints as "Research Sprints" that enabled me to build this proprietary architecture.

See you at 6!

Warmly,

Leon Basin
Founder | Basin::Nexus
