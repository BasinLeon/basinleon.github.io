## The Big Picture

Your resume is **missing your biggest differentiator**: The fact that you code. The website positions you as "The Revenue Architect Who Codes" but your resume doesn't emphasize this. 

**This is a critical gap.** Hiring managers looking at your resume won't see:
- 83,000+ lines of code
- BASIN::NEXUS v10.0
- 19 repositories
- 5 LLMs orchestrated

**These are your competitive advantages.** They need to be on your resume.
