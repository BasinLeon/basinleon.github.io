# EXEC PREP // THE STRATEGIC PIVOT ONE-PAGER
**Role:** GTM Architect / Technical Implementation Lead
**Mission:** Secure Partnership/Project with Peak Waves (Lisa Carter)

---

## 📅 THE RITUAL: THURSDAY FEB 5 @ 12:00 PM PST

### 1. MONDAY: THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (Email/DM)
> "Hi Lisa, Thursday at 12:00 PM PST works perfectly. I appreciate the clarity on your 'Strategy-First' focus. My goal for our sync is specifically to align on that diagnostic layer. I've prepared a brief that highlights where technical architecture supports (not replaces) the GTM logic. See you then!"

### 2. THURSDAY: THE ALIGNMENT (The Sync)
*   **Step 1: The Brief (PDF).** Open `PEAK_WAVES_SIGNAL_MECHANICS.html`. Focus on the **DIAGNOSE** phase first.
*   **Step 2: The Proof (Strategic Six).** Walk through Fudo, Sense, Basin::Nexus Internal, TalSmart, BRM, and Ambient. 
*   **Step 3: The Demo (Simulator).** Open `NEXUS_SIGNAL_BLUEPRINT.html`. Run the simulation. Let the logs sell the "Logic."
*   **Step 4: The Close (Partner Model).** Pivot from "Hire Me" to "Let's Productize Peak Waves."

## 🦅 EXECUTIVE NOTES
*   **Tone:** Strategy-aligned, professional, architectural.
*   **Pivot:** Shift from "Automation" to "Technical Undercurrent for Diagnosis."
*   **The Win:** Position yourself as the "Technical Partner" who ensures her strategy doesn't get blamed for a client's execution failure.
