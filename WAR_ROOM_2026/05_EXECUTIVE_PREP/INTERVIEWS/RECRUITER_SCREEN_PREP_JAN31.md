## 1. THE OPENER: "TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF"
*Do not give a chronological history. Give a Thesis Statement.*

**The Script:**
"I’ve spent the last 15 years in GTM leadership—from Google to Series A startups like Fudo Security.

But what I realized a few years ago is that **Revenue Operations is broken.** We hire humans to do robot work (copy-pasting leads, formatting data).

So, I evolved. I stopped just *running* sales teams and started **building the systems** that make them successful.

Today, I call myself a **Revenue Architect**. I use code (Python, AI) to build automated engines that find leads and close deals, so my humans can focus on relationships.

I’m looking for a role where I can deploy that 'Builder' mindset—whether that's as a Technical Account Manager, a Solutions Engineer, or a GTM Leader."

## 2. THE BEHAVIORAL BLOCK ("TELL ME A TIME...")

### A. "Tell me a time you solved a complex problem."
*Story: The SDR Automation (Project Sentinel)*
*   **Problem:** At Fudo, we had 10 SDRs sending generic spam. Pipeline was $0.
*   **Action:** I didn't just "manage" them. I built a Python system that scraped "Hiring Signals" (e.g., companies hiring CISOs).
*   **Result:** We replaced the 10-person manual team with 2 strategic SDRs + my code. Output went UP by 71%. Savings: $400k/year.

### B. "Tell me a time you handled conflict/pushback."
*Story: The "Fixer" (Deal Rescue)*
*   **Problem:** Our Engineering team and the Client's CISO were speaking different languages. The deal was stalled.
*   **Action:** I flew out. I didn't sell features. I sat with the CISO and white-boarded the *architecture*. Then I translated that back to my Engineering team.
*   **Result:** Bridged the gap and closed the 6-figure deal. I speak both "Sales" and "Code."

## 3. THE "TECHNICAL IMPOSSIBLITY" DEFENSE
*You are worried they will ask "How does Vector Search work?" Here are the 1-sentence "Architect" answers.*

**Q: "I see 'Vector DB' on here. What do you use that for?"**
*   **The Answer:** "I use it for **Semantic Search**. Traditional databases look for *keywords* (e.g., matching 'Sales'). Vector DBs look for *meaning* (e.g., understanding that 'Revenue Leader' and 'Head of Sales' are the same thing). It helps me route leads better."

**Q: "Why Supabase?"**
*   **The Answer:** "It’s just an open-source database (Postgres). I like it because it handles all the security and backend stuff for me, so I can focus on the business logic. It's where I store my 'Whale' leads."

**Q: "Why N8N?"**
*   **The Answer:** "It’s like Zapier, but for enterprise. It lets me visually build workflows (like 'If LinkedIn Post = Hiring -> Send Slack Alert') without writing boilerplate code. It breaks less often."

**Q: "How strong is your Python?"**
*   **The Answer:** "I am not a Core Kernel Engineer. I am a **'Glue Code' Engineer**. I write Python to connect systems (APIs, CRM, AI). I build tools that make money, not operating systems."

## 4. THE CLOSER: "WHY US?"
*(Need to tailor this to the specific company, but generally:)*

"I love that you are [Solving X / Building Y]. Ideally, you need someone who understands the **commercial side** (how to close deals) but can also **get technical** (understand the product/API). That hybrid role is exactly where I thrive."
