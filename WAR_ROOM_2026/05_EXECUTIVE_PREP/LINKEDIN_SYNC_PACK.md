## 2. About Section
**Copy/Paste:**
> I solve the scaling gap between GTM Strategy and Technical Infrastructure. Most companies hire a RevOps manager to administer tools; I architect the automated systems that eliminate the need for administration entirely.
>
> **The "Human Latency" Problem:**
> 15 years across Google, SurveyMonkey, and Fudo Security taught me that deals don't die because of bad product; they die because of "Human Latency." Hot market signals (funding news, API errors, hiring spikes) sit in a database for 48 hours because a human has to manually find, score, and route them.
>
> **The Solution: Signal Engineering**
> I build "Signal Refineries"—Python-native engines that ingest dark web/social data, score it with LLMs (Claude/DeepSeek), and route high-intent leads to sellers in <400ms.
>
> **Proven Impact:**
> 🚀 **$30M+** Pipeline Generated | 📈 **160%** Pipeline Growth
> 💼 **$300M+** Portfolio Managed | 📉 **$424K** Annual Savings
> ⚡️ **<400ms** Signal Latency | 🏎️ **5 Days** SDR Ramp Time
> 💻 **88,000+** Lines of Code | 🎯 **35%** Reply Lift
>
> **Core Competencies:**
> • **Technical:** Python, API Orchestration (Clay/n8n), LLM Agent Design
> • **Strategic:** Pipeline Ops, Deal Architecture, Executive Revenue Strategy
