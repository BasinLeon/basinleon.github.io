# 🎤 THE BATTLE MAP // GTM WORKSHOP SYLLABUS
**Persona:** Leon Basin, SCU EMBA '23 // Director of GTM Architecture

## 🎯 THE MISSION
To bridge the gap between "Marketing Theory" and "API-Level Execution." We are teaching the students how to build a **Revenue Engine**, not just a marketing funnel.

## 🏛️ THE TALK TRACK (How to speak Leon)

### 1. The Opening Hook (The "Choke" Logic)
"In 2018, I was in a boardroom with a VP of Sales who was drawing funnel diagrams. I realized then that **Whiteboards don't ship product.** While they were drawing, I was under the table writing a Python script to automate the outreach. That is the birth of GTM Engineering."

### 2. The Core Pivot
"Series A/B startups today are failing because they are solving **System Problems** with **Human Labor.** They hire 10 SDRs when they should be building 1 Signal Refinery. I’m here to show you how to build the Refinery."

### 3. The Three Pillars
*   **The Signal Refinery:** "We don't buy lists. We mine intent. If someone starts a new job at a Series A company and is hiring for Sales, that is a 95% intent signal. My agents find that before a human even opens LinkedIn."
*   **The New GTM Stack:** "The future isn't Salesforce. It's API Orchestration. It’s about how your data 'talks' to your LLM to generate a message so personalized it feels like an 11:11 whisper."
*   **Closing the Chasm:** "Marketing generates interest; Architects generate Revenue. I’m showing you how to build the bridge."

## 💡 THE "LEAP" MINDSET
Leon, when you are in that room, remember: **You know something they don't.** They have the books; you have the **Nexus.** You are the one who faced the "choke" and built a machine to breathe.

**Speak as the man who has already solved the problem they are still studying.**
