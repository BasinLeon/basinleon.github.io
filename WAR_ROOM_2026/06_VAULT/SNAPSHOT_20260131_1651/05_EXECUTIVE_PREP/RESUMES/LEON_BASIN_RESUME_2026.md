## Executive Summary

I don't just sell technology. I build the engine. 15+ years of GTM leadership across Google, SurveyMonkey, and Series A cybersecurity companies taught me Revenue Ops is limited by linear thinking. I am now architecting the shift from Classical GTM to **Quantum GTM Engineering**.

**The Quantum GTM Architect:**
- **90,000+ lines of code** across Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Streamlit
- **22-Layer Quantum Stack**: Architected a multi-dimensional GTM substrate from hardware compute to superposed outcome strategies.
- **CD-to-QD Transformation**: Pioneered the conversion of Classical Data into Quantum-Intent signals to solve for absolute probability in deal-closing.
- **Built BASIN::NEXUS v11.0 Quantum Evolution**: Fully autonomous GTM OS utilizing sparse neural networks and recursive feedback loops.

**Proven Results:**
- **$23M+ Career Pipeline** | **160% Pipeline Growth** | **$424K Annual Savings** | **5 Days SDR Ramp** (vs. 3-month average)
