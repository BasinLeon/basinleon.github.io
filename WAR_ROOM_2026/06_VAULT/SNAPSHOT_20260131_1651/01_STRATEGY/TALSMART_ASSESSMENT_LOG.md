## QUESTION 1
**Q:** What is a technology sales campaign?
**A:** **The realization/implementation of your solution's go-to-market strategy**
*Rationale: Aligns with the 'Strategy' axis of Jassi's 3D Model. A campaign is the architectural vehicle for GTM.*

## QUESTION 2
**Q:** What is the purpose of an effective opening when prospecting for an IT services opportunity?
**A:** **Create an opening script that will answer your Prospect's 5 Key Q's and establish immediate credibility, business rapport, and intended purpose.**
*Rationale: Direct application of the '5 Q's Methodology' (Who/Why/Credentials/Relevance/Urgency).*

## QUESTION 3
**Q:** What words would buyers most likely use to describe salespeople?
**A:** **Slick, Sleazy.**
*Rationale: Jassi teaches that the "Salesman" archetype is dead because prospects have high immunity/distrust. This is why we pivot to being "Sam" (The Trusted Advisor/Partner). [Note: Pushy/Aggressive is a close second, but 'Slick/Sleazy' is the classic TalSmart psychological baseline for why we need the 5 Q's].*
