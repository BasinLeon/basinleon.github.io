# LISA CARTER FOLLOW-UP | Coretus SOW

---

**TO:** Lisa Carter <lisa@peakwavesstudio.com>
**FROM:** Leon Basin
**SUBJECT:** RE: Coretus — Signal Validation SOW

---

Hi Lisa,

Hope you're well. Following up on the white-label scope we discussed.

I'm available for a quick sync:
- **Wednesday (tomorrow):** 2:00 PM, 3:00 PM, or 4:00 PM PT
- **Thursday:** 10:00 AM or 11:00 AM PT

For the Signal Validation phase, here's what I'm proposing:

---

### Scope: Market Signal Audit (Phase 1 Support)

**Objective:** Validate the "Constraint Map" with external buyer signals—not internal opinion.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Buyer Interviews (3-5):** I conduct discovery calls with actual enterprise buyers/prospects to validate PMF assumptions.
2. **Signal Synthesis Report:** A 2-page brief summarizing buying triggers, objections, and competitive positioning.
3. **Pipeline Architecture Draft:** Routing logic for how Coretus should score and prioritize inbound leads.

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks, parallel to your Diagnosis phase.

**Investment:** $3,500 flat for Phase 1 (includes interviews, synthesis, and one review session with you).

---

This keeps your role as the GTM owner clean while giving Coretus market-validated data to anchor the strategy.

Let me know which slot works, and I'll send the calendar invite.

Best,
**Leon**

## WHY THIS PRICING

| Rate | Logic |
|------|-------|
| **$3,500 flat** | ~10-12 hours of work. Positions you as senior, not cheap. |
| **Flat vs. hourly** | Easier for Lisa to pass through to client. No scope negotiation. |
| **Leaves room** | If Phase 1 goes well, Phase 2 (Tune-Up support) could be $5-7k. |

## TIMING

- [ ] Send this email **Wednesday morning (tomorrow)** before the Jassi meeting
