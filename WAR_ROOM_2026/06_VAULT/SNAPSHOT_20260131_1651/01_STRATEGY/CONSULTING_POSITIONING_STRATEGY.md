# 🎯 Consulting on Job Search Site: Strategic Analysis

**Question:** Is having consulting on the same website you send to hiring managers a bad look?

**Short Answer:** It CAN be, depending on HOW it's positioned. But it can also be a STRENGTH if positioned correctly.

---

## ⚠️ **THE RISKS**

### **What Hiring Managers Might Think:**
1. ❌ "They're doing consulting, so they're not serious about full-time"
2. ❌ "They might leave to go back to consulting"
3. ❌ "They're not committed to being an employee"
4. ❌ "They're just using this as a backup plan"
5. ❌ "They'll be distracted by consulting work"

### **When It's a Red Flag:**
- Consulting is prominently featured on homepage
- "Available for consulting" messaging is front and center
- Consulting CTAs compete with "Hire Me" CTAs
- Pricing/packages are visible to hiring managers
- No clear commitment to full-time work

---

## ✅ **WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY A STRENGTH**

### **What Hiring Managers Might Think:**
1. ✅ "They're in-demand and have real expertise"
2. ✅ "They've proven they can deliver value independently"
3. ✅ "They have real-world experience, not just theory"
4. ✅ "They're entrepreneurial and can build things"
5. ✅ "They understand business from multiple angles"

### **When It Works:**
- Consulting is positioned as "past experience" or "side project"
- Clear messaging: "Seeking full-time role, consulting was interim"
- Consulting shows proof of work, not current availability
- Case studies demonstrate expertise, not active business
- Clear commitment to full-time employment

---

## 🎯 **STRATEGIC OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Hide/De-Emphasize Consulting (Safest)**
**Best for:** Active job search, want zero risk

**Actions:**
- Remove "Consulting" from main navigation

**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero risk of confusion
- ✅ Clear focus on job search
- ✅ No mixed signals

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lose consulting opportunities
- ❌ Can't show consulting work as proof

---

### **Option 2: Reposition as "Past Experience" (Recommended)**

**Actions:**
- Change "Consulting" to "Projects" or "Case Studies"
- Remove pricing/packages
- Remove "Available for consulting" messaging
- Add: "Previously consulted for Series A companies"
- Frame as: "Here's what I built when consulting"

**Messaging:**
- ❌ "I offer consulting services"

### **Option 3: Create Job-Search-Specific Version (Best of Both)**

**Actions:**

- Clean version: No consulting, just portfolio
- Keep main site with consulting
- Send hiring managers to clean version
- Keep consulting on main site for consulting clients

**Structure:**
```
basinleon.github.io/                    → Full site (consulting + job search)
basinleon.github.io/for-hiring-managers/ → Clean version (job search only)
```

**Pros:**

### **Option 4: Smart Positioning (Current + Refinement)**

- Make homepage 100% job search focused
- Consulting page: "Previously consulted, now seeking full-time"

**Messaging Examples:**

- Navigation: Keep consulting link but make it less prominent

**Pros:**
- ✅ Minimal changes needed
