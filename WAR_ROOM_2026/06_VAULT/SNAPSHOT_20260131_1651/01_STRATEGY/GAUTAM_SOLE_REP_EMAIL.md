**TO:** Gautam @ Quantum World Technologies
**FROM:** Leon Basin
**DATE:** January 27, 2026
**RE:** Sole Representation Confirmation for Tredence Opportunity

---

Gautam,

Thank you for presenting the **Tredence** opportunity. I want to formalize our working relationship before the process advances further.

## Confirmation of Terms

I am confirming **Quantum World Technologies as my sole representative** for the Tredence Analytics opportunity. This means:

1. **Exclusivity:** I will not engage with Tredence directly or through any other agency for this specific role.
2. **Communication:** All negotiations, interview scheduling, and offer discussions will flow through you.
3. **Transparency:** I expect full visibility into compensation discussions, including base, bonus structure, and any equity components.

## My Commitment

In exchange for your advocacy:

- I will prioritize Tredence interviews in my schedule
- I will provide same-day responses to all interview requests
- I will be fully transparent about competing offers and timelines

## Current Status

For your awareness, I have multiple active opportunities in final stages. To ensure we move with appropriate urgency:

| Opportunity | Stage | Timeline |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Tredence | Early/Mid | TBD |
| [Competing Opp] | Final Round | This week |

I want to give Tredence full consideration, but I need the process to move efficiently.

## Next Steps

Please confirm:
1. ✅ You accept sole representation for this opportunity
2. ✅ Expected interview timeline from Tredence
3. ✅ Base salary range they've indicated ($150k floor confirmed?)

Looking forward to a productive partnership on this.

Best,
**Leon Basin**
