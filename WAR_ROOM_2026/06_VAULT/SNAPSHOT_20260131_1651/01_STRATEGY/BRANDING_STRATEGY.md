## Branding Recommendations

### 1. Own "The Revenue Architect Who Codes"
- Make it your tagline

- Build content around it

### 2. Lead with Story, Not Services
- Don't say "I do GTM consulting"
- Say "I build revenue systems that replace headcount"
- Show, don't tell

### 3. Modern, Not Corporate
- Keep the "Web 3.0" aesthetic (gold, dark, futuristic)
- But make it authentic, not gimmicky
- Code-first, not sales-first

### 4. The Consulting Page Should Tell a Story
- Not just services and prices
- Show the journey: Audit → Architecture → Deployment
- Make it about transformation, not transactions

## Action Items

1. ✅ Improve "For Hiring Managers" section (more compelling, story-driven)
2. ✅ Evolve consulting page (story-first, not service-first)
3. ✅ Define brand positioning clearly
4. ✅ Create consistent messaging across all touchpoints

That's your mark on the world.
