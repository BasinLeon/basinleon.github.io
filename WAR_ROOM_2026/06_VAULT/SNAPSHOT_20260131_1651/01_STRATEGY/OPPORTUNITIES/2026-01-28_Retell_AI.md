Subject: Founding Sales Engineer role - Leon Basin (Revenue Architect)

Hi Hiring Team,

I saw the Founding Sales Engineer role open at Retell AI and it aligns perfectly with the system I'm building.

I'm a Revenue Architect bridging the gap between Sales leadership and Engineering. I don't just run ops; I build "zero-latency" revenue systems using Python and AI agents.

My background:
- Operations at Google/NetApp (Scale)
- Sales at SurveyMonkey/Sense (Execution)
- Engineering at Fudo (Building)

I'm currently deploying a custom signal refinery called Basin::Nexus. I'd love to show you how it could apply to Retell AI's GTM motion.

Best,
Leon Basin
