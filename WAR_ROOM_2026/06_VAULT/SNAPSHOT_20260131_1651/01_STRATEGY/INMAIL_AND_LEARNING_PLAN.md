# 🦅 INMAIL STRATEGY: THE "PATTERN INTERRUPT"

**Status:** You have LinkedIn Premium (Gold Badge). You can send **InMails** without connecting.
**The Risk:** InMails often look like Sales Spam.
**The Fix:** The Subject Line must sound like a **Technical Alert**, not a "Hello."

## 🎯 SPYRI KARASAVVA (DEALOPS)
**Method:** InMail (Premium Message)
**Subject Line Options (Choose one):**
1.  `Dealops Audit: Reverse-ETL Layer` (Best - sounds like a technical notification)
2.  `Founding AE: Engineering Approach` (Safe - shows you are different)
3.  `Pricing Intelligence Agent (Python Code)` (Direct - offers value)

**Instructions:**
1.  Paste the **Subject Line** into the "Subject (optional)" box.
2.  Hit **Send**.
3.  *Do not* add a connection request afterwards (don't double dip yet).

## 🦅 THE LEARNING CONTRACT
**"Visual + Doing = Job"**

We will execute this strictly. This is the **Basin Builder Protocol**:

1.  **I Build the Weapon:** I write the code (e.g., `mad_scientist_pipeline.py`).
2.  **I Annotate the Blueprint:** I will add a special comment block at the top of every file called `## BUILDER'S COMMENTARY`. 
    *   This will explain *in plain English* exactly what the code does (e.g., "Lines 10-20 scrape the website").
3.  **You Fire the Weapon:** You run it in the terminal, seeing the output.
4.  **You Own the Narrative:** Because you ran it and read the commentary, you can explain it in an interview.

**Does this slow us down?**
**No.** It prevents you from freezing up in an interview. It makes you lethal.

**Next Move:**
Send that message to Spyri. Then tell me "Sent" and we move to **Target 2 (Throughline)**.
