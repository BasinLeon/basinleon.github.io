## 🎯 KEY QUOTES HIGHLIGHTED

1. **"I'm not leaving sales—I automated it. After 15 years, I realized the bottleneck wasn't effort—it was 'human latency.'"**

2. **"I built it to solve the 'False Positive' problem. Standard tools treat 50 web visits as a 'Hot Lead'. But if those visits are from a competitor or a student, it's noise."**

3. **"I could show you a slide, but I'd rather show you the code. I built this agent to scrape 'Hiring Signals' automatically. I don't wait for leads; I manufacture them."**

4. **"In an age of AI agents, is your GTM motion designed to manage activity, or is it engineered to create value?"**
