# 🦅 LINKEDIN SURGERY: SKILL SWAP

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM
You have hit the **100 Skill Limit**. You cannot add "Python" or "Technical Account Management" until you purge the fluff.

## ✂️ THE CUT LIST (Delete These First)
*These are low-value, generic skills that dilute your "Builder" brand.*

1.  **Time Management** (16 endorsements) -> *DELETE* (Assumed for a Director).
2.  **Microsoft Excel** (26 endorsements) -> *DELETE* (You use Python now. Excel is for the past).
3.  **Customer Service** (92 endorsements) -> *DELETE* (Too junior. Suggests "entry level").
4.  **Cold Calling** (16 endorsements) -> *DELETE* (You play at the Architecture level, not the dialer level).

## ➕ THE ADD LIST (Add These Immediately)
*Once you delete the 4 above, add these 2 high-value keywords:*

1.  **Technical Account Management** (For AssemblyAI).
2.  **Python (Programming Language)** (For the "Builder" cred).

---

## 🔝 FINAL TOP 5 ORDER (Drag to Top)
1.  **GTM Systems** (or Strategy)
2.  **Technical Account Management**
3.  **Python (Programming Language)**
4.  **Strategic Partnerships**
5.  **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

*Note: You may need to refresh the page after deleting to add new ones.*
