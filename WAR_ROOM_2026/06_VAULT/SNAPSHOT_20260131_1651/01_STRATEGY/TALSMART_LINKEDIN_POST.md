## THE POST

**Headline:** GTM is moving from 'Volume' to 'Architecture.'

Spent the morning auditing Jassi Singh’s 'Predictive Prospecting' frameworks and completing the @TALSMART Software Sales Skills Assessment.

The takeaway is clear: Most outbound motions fail today because they are built on a 2D plane—linking a Person to a Product.

To cut through a high-immunity market, you need a 3D lens: **Strategy + Technology + Revenue.** 

It's the difference between being a salesman who makes noise and a Revenue Architect who builds a **Signal Refinery.** 

Proud to have these frameworks validated as I continue building the Basin::Nexus engine.
