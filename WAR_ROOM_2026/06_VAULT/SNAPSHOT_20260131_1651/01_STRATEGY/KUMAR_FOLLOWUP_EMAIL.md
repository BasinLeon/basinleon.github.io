# KUMAR FOLLOW-UP | Post-Jassi Meeting
## Send AFTER the 1:30 PM CoachRobo meeting

**TO:** Kumar Sarangee <ksarangee@scu.edu>
**FROM:** Leon Basin
**SUBJECT:** Update: Revenue Architect session + Pilot closed

---

Kumar,

Thank you again for the intro to Cristina. I'm already coordinating a **"Revenue Architect" session** for the BVA founders.

Thought you'd appreciate this: I've officially forked my AI operating system ([Basin::Operator](https://github.com/BasinLeon/Basin-Operator)) and am using it to run a pilot for a SaaS founder I met this week.

My goal is to bridge the **"Innovation-to-Revenue" gap** you often discuss in your research—specifically, helping technical founders move from product-market fit to repeatable revenue without burning capital on premature SDR hires.

I'm looking for one more **"Builder-stage" founder** to pilot this Nexus architecture. If anyone in your circle is struggling with lead decay or flat GTM, I'd love to show them what I'm building.

Best,
**Leon**

## TIMING

Send this email:
- [ ] After Jassi says YES → Include: "Just closed a pilot with a SaaS founder today."
- [ ] After Jassi says MAYBE → Include: "Running a pilot discussion with a SaaS founder this week."
- [ ] Either way, send within 24 hours of the Jassi meeting

## WHY THIS WORKS

1. **Shows execution, not asks** — You're updating him on progress, not requesting favors
2. **Seeds the "one more founder" ask** — He'll think of someone. Professors always know someone.
3. **Ties to his academic work** — "Innovation-to-Revenue gap" sounds like something he'd teach
