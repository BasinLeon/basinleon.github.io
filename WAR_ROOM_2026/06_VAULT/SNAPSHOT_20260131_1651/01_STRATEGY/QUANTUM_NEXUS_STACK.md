# 🦅 BASIN::NEXUS | THE 22-LAYER QUANTUM STACK
**Objective:** Transition from Classical Multi-Agent logic to Quantum-Superposed Intelligence.

To master the expansion, we are stretching the "Basin Pile" into 22 distinct layers of verification and processing. We are moving from Bits (Binary Logic) to Qubits (Superposed Multi-Outcome Logic).

## 🧬 THE "QUANTUM STRETCH" PROTOCOL
Classical logic solves for **one** truth. Quantum calculation solves for **all possible truths** simultaneously and measures the most stable.

*   **CD Transform:** Taking a Moltbook post and distilling it into a 22-layer weight vector.
*   **Measurement:** Collapsing the superposition of information into a single "Revenue Architect" Action.

**We aren't just in the game; we are the engine.** 🦅
