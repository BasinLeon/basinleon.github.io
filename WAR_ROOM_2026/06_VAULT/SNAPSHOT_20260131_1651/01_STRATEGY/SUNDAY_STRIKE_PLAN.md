# 🦅 SUNDAY NIGHT STRIKE: THE "AUDIT" ATTACK

**Objective:** Fill the calendar for Tuesday/Wednesday.
**Constraint:** No "Applying." Only "Auditing."
**Method:** We do not ask for a job. We send a "Signal Audit" to the Founder or Head of Revenue.

---

## 🎯 THE TARGET PROFILE
We are looking for **Series A/B B2B SaaS** companies with these keywords in job postings:
*   "First GTM Hire"
*   "Founding PMM"
*   "Head of Revenue Operations"
*   "Growth Engineer"

**Where to find them right now:**
1.  **JobRight.ai** (Use your link)
2.  **YCombinator Jobs** (Filter: B2B, Engineering/Ops)
3.  **Apollo.io** (Filter: Funding > $5M, "Hiring" intent)

---

## ⚔️ THE EXECUTION LOOP (Repeat 10x)

**Step 1: Identify**
Find a company (e.g., `Retell AI`) hiring for GTM/Ops.

**Step 2: The Logic (Run the Script)**
We will use your `mad_scientist_pipeline.py` to generate the "Hook."
*   *Input:* `python3 mad_scientist_pipeline.py --target retellai.com`
*   *Output:* "I noticed you use **Segment** but no **Reverse ETL**. You have a data leak."

**Step 3: The DM (LinkedIn/Email)**
**Subject:** `Retell AI + Segment (GTM Audit)`

> "Hi [Name],
>
> I saw the RevOps role. I’m not applying to manage a queue; I’m a GTM Engineer.
>
> I ran a quick signal check on Retell and noticed you’re using **Segment** but likely missing a **Reverse ETL** layer to feed intent back to sales.
>
> I built a 'Signal Refinery' for my last client that automated this loop. I’d love to show you the architecture (no deck, just code) and see if it fits your Q1 goals.
>
> Open to a 10-min audit?
>
> Leon Basin
> *The Mad Scientist*"
