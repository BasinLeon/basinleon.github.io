# 🦅 LINKEDIN AUDIT: 95% COMPLETE

## ✅ THE WINS (Locked In)
*   **Headline:** Perfect. "Signal Refineries" + "Python/AI Engine" creates immediate authority.
*   **Fudo Security:** This is your strongest role now. "Technical Deal Rescue" and "Engineered the Partner Mesh" position you exactly as a TAM who sells.
*   **Sense:** "Pipeline Engineering" and "Retention Logic" proves you think in systems, not just activity.
*   **Skills:** "Technical Account Management" and "Python" are visible. This is critical for the AssemblyAI algorithm.

## ⚠️ ONE FINAL FIX: SURVEYMONKEY
*Current:* It still has the generic company tagline: *"Powering the curious by helping companies turn feedback into action..."*
*Why fix:* Recruiters skim. You want them to see "Solution Selling" and "Signal-Based Outbound" immediately, not marketing fluff.

**ACTION: Update the SurveyMonkey Description to this:**

```text

• Solution Selling: Partnered with Solution Engineers to map complex feedback data workflows for Fortune 500 clients.
• Signal-Based Outbound: Pioneered early 'intent-based' prospecting methods, leveraging IPO and hiring signals to break into key accounts.
