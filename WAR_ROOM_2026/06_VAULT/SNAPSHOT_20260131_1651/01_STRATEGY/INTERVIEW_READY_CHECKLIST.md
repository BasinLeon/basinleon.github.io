## 💻 **THE MAGIC TRICK SETUP**

**Terminal Command:**
```bash
cd "/Users/basin/Desktop/untitled folder/Basin & Associates 🌍"
python3 enrich_company.py
```

**Talk Track (BRM):**
> "I could show you a slide, but I'd rather show you the code. I built this agent to scrape 'Hiring Signals' automatically. I don't wait for leads; I manufacture them."

**Talk Track (Mastech):**
> "This isn't just a script. This is a micro-example of Data Modernization. I take raw, messy web data and structure it into a clean JSON object your sales team can actually use. That is the value Mastech sells: turning noise into signal."
