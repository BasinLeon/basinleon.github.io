## The Issue

**Before:** Consulting page had NO navigation - users were stuck!
**After:** Consulting page now has full navigation including Blog and Library

## Why Both Sites Need Blog & Library

### Blog:
- **Professional Site:** Thought leadership, case studies, career insights
- **Consulting Site:** GTM frameworks, methodologies, client success stories
- **Shared Resource:** Both audiences benefit from content

### Library:
- **Professional Site:** Resources for hiring managers to understand your work
- **Consulting Site:** Frameworks and tools for potential clients
- **Shared Resource:** Valuable content for both audiences

## Navigation Strategy

### Both Sites Should Have:
1. **Home** - Links to respective homepage
2. **Blog** - Shared content (GTM insights, case studies)
3. **Library** - Shared resources (frameworks, tools)
4. **Case Studies** - Shared proof of work
5. **Consulting** - Link to consulting page (or active if on consulting page)
6. **Contact** - Contact form/email

---

## Result

✅ **Professional Site:** Full navigation with Blog, Library, Case Studies
✅ **Consulting Site:** NOW has full navigation with Blog, Library, Case Studies
✅ **Both Sites:** Can access all shared resources
✅ **Clear Separation:** Different homepages, same shared resources

---

## What Changed

1. ✅ Added navigation bar to consulting page
2. ✅ Added Blog link
3. ✅ Added Library link
4. ✅ Added Case Studies link
5. ✅ Added "Explore More" section at bottom
6. ✅ Consistent navigation across both sites
