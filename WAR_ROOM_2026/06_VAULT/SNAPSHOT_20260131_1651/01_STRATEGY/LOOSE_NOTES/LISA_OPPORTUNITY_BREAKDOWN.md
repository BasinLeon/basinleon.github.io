## 🎯 WHAT LISA IS ASKING FOR

### **The Situation:**
- Lisa found a GTM strategy opportunity with a medium-sized software company
- They serve enterprise-grade clients
- They need GTM strategy and systems
- **Lisa wants to lead this project** (it would be her first time as GTM strategy lead)
- Proposal is due Monday morning

### **What She's Asking You To Do:**

2. **Review her proposal** - Give feedback on her proposal draft
3. **Identify what you could contribute** - Tell her what you could add/help with
4. **Support her** - Help her succeed in leading this (not take over)

## 💡 WHAT "SUPPORT ME IN THE GTM STRATEGY LEAD POSITION" MEANS

**Translation:**
- Lisa wants to be the **primary GTM strategy lead** on this project
- She's asking you to be a **supporting advisor/consultant**
- You'd help her think through strategy, review her work, provide feedback
- But **she leads** - you support

**Think of it like:**
- She's the **project lead**
- You're the **senior advisor/mentor**
- She does the work, you provide guidance
- She presents to the client, you help her prepare

## 🤔 WHAT THIS COULD MEAN FOR YOU

### **Potential Outcomes:**

**Option 1: Advisory Role**
- You review her proposal, give feedback
- She leads the project
- You might get a small advisory fee or equity
- You build relationship, she gets experience

**Option 2: Collaboration**
- You contribute specific expertise (signal detection, pipeline architecture)
- She leads overall strategy
- You might get a portion of the project fee
- You both win

**Option 3: Just Help (Relationship Building)**
- You review and give feedback as a favor
- She leads the project
- You build relationship, no financial gain
- But you become known as helpful expert

## 🎯 WHAT YOU SHOULD DO

### **Immediate Response:**
1. **Say yes to reviewing** - It's a relationship-building opportunity
2. **Set clear boundaries** - You'll review and advise, not take over
3. **Ask questions** - Understand the opportunity better
4. **Be helpful** - Share your expertise, frameworks, insights

### **Questions to Ask:**
- What's the scope of the project? (Full GTM build? Strategy only?)
- What's the timeline? (Quick win? Long-term engagement?)
- What's the budget? (How much are they paying?)
- What's your role vs. mine? (Who does what?)

### **What to Offer:**
- ✅ Review proposal and give feedback
- ✅ Share frameworks (signal detection, tiered campaigns)
- ✅ Help think through strategy
- ✅ Be available as sounding board
- ✅ Support her in leading (not take over)

### **What NOT to Offer:**
- ❌ Take over the project
- ❌ Do the work for her
- ❌ Compete for the lead role
- ❌ Work for free if it's a paid project

## 💰 THE MONEY QUESTION

**What She Said:**
- "as a favor" - Suggests she might want free help
- "so long as you do not take over the bulk of the work" - She wants to lead

**What You Should Clarify:**
- If this is a paid project, what's the compensation structure?
- If you contribute significantly, what's your share?
- If it's just advisory, is there a fee or is it relationship-building?

**Reality Check:**
- If it's a $50K+ project and you're doing significant work, you should get paid
- If it's just reviewing a proposal, maybe it's relationship-building
- If you're contributing frameworks/expertise, you should get something

### **Step 2: Get More Info**

- What you need (compensation if significant contribution)

### **Step 4: Be Collaborative**
- Help her succeed
- Share your expertise
