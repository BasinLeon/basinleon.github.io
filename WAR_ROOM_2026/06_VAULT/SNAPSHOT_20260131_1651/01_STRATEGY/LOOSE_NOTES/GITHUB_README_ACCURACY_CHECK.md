# GitHub README Accuracy Check vs Website

## Issues Found

### ❌ **CRITICAL: Profile Header Inconsistency**

**GitHub Profile Header:**
```
I Engineer Governed GTM Infrastructure | $23M+ Career Pipeline | 5-Day SDR Ramp | 27,000+ Lines | Ex-Google, Fudo, SurveyMonkey | MBA
```

```

   - **Recommendation:** Already fixed in README ✅

## Required Fixes

### 1. **Fix GitHub Profile Header** (Most Important)
The profile header shows "27,000+ Lines" but should be "83,000+ Lines"

**How to fix:**
- Go to GitHub Settings → Profile
- Update the bio/description
- Change: `27,000+ Lines` → `83,000+ Lines`

### 2. **Update Tagline in README** (Optional)
The README uses the old tagline. Consider updating to match website:
- Old: "I Don't Just Sell Technology — I Engineer Governed GTM Infrastructure"
- New: "I Build Revenue Systems That Scale Revenue, Not Teams"
