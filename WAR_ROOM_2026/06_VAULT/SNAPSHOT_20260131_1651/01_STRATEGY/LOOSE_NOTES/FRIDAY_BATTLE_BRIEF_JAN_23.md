# ⚔️ THE FRIDAY BATTLE BRIEF (Jan 23)

**Objective:** Secure the "Builder" role (BRM) or the "Executive" role (Mastech).

---

## FINAL ORDER
- **Terminal:** Open & Clear. Minimize (do not close). Ready for **Command + Tab**.
- **Phone:** Silent.
- **Mindset:** You are the expert in the room.
- **This document:** On your secondary monitor or printed.

**Forget the other files. This is the only thing you need.**

---

## PHASE 1: THE SETUP (10:45 AM)

**Clean the Desk:** No clutter. Just your laptop and this document.

**The "Magic Trick" (Terminal):**
1. Open Terminal.
2. `cd` into this folder: `"/Users/basin/Desktop/untitled folder/Basin & Associates 🌍"`
3. Type `clear` to wipe it clean.
4. **Minimize it (do not close).** It must be ready for **Command + Tab**.
5. **The Command:** `python3 enrich_company.py` *(Memorize this.)*

## PHASE 2: THE BUILDER INTERVIEW (11:00 AM)

**Company:** BRM Labs  
**Interviewer:** Lane Hartman  
**Persona:** The GTM Engineer. Scrappy, Technical, "Hoodie Energy."

### ❓ WHAT THEY DO (Cheat Sheet)
- **Product:** "SuperAgents" — Autonomous AI workers, not just chatbots.
- **Value:** Labor replacement. Agents do the work end-to-end.
- **Your Angle:** *"I don't just sell the software; I build the workforce."*

### 💬 THE SCRIPT

**"Tell Me About Yourself":**
> "I'm a 15-year Enterprise Sales Leader who stopped waiting for Engineering to solve my problems. I realized the future isn't 'more SDRs,' it's Agentic Workflows. So I taught myself Python to build my own prospecting agents. I want to sell BRM's agents by using them to build the GTM machine."

**The "Magic Trick":**
- **Trigger:** When Lane asks *"How technical are you?"* or *"How do you hunt?"*
- **Action:** Share Screen → Switch to Terminal → Run **`python3 enrich_company.py`**
- **Talk Track:** *"I could show you a slide, but I'd rather show you the code. I built this agent to scrape 'Hiring Signals' automatically. I don't wait for leads; I manufacture them."*

**Killer Questions (Ask Lane):**
1. *"Lane, are we selling to the Developer (who wants an API) or the Ops Leader (who wants a solution)? Because I speak both languages."*
2. *"How much autonomy will I have to dogfood our own agents to run the sales process?"*

## PHASE 3: THE CODE-SWITCH (11:45 AM)

**Mental Reset:** Stand up. Stretch.  
**Persona Change:** You are no longer the "Hacker." You are now the **"Suit."**  
**Vibe:** Polished, Strategic, Data-Fluent.

---

## PHASE 4: THE EXECUTIVE INTERVIEW (12:00 PM)

**Company:** Mastech Digital  
**Interviewer:** Christopher Tuma  
**Persona:** The Revenue Architect. Strategic, Polished, "Suit Energy."

### ❓ WHAT THEY DO (Cheat Sheet)
- **Product:** Pivoting from IT Staffing to **Data Modernization.**
- **Strategy:** Partner with **Informatica.** Help big companies clean their "Data House" (Data Fabric) so they can eventually use AI.
- **Your Angle:** *"You can't sell AI to a client if their data is messy."*

### 💬 THE SCRIPT

**"Tell Me About Yourself":**
> "I am an Enterprise Sales Director who specializes in Complex Solution Selling. I've spent the last few years at the intersection of Revenue Strategy and Data Infrastructure. I don't just sell 'staffing'; I scope Data Modernization projects. I understand that a client can't adopt AI until their data is clean, and that's why I'm here."

**The "Magic Trick" (Same Code, New Frame):**
- **Trigger:** When Christopher asks about your process or data skills.
- **Action:** Share Screen → Run the **SAME** code: **`python3 enrich_company.py`**
- **Talk Track:** *"This isn't just a script. This is a micro-example of Data Modernization. I take raw, messy web data and structure it into a clean JSON object your sales team can actually use. That is the value Mastech sells: turning noise into signal."*

**Killer Questions (Ask Christopher):**
1. *"With the Informatica partnership, are we primarily attaching to their Cloud Modernization deals? That's where I see the biggest consulting opportunity."*
2. *"Are you looking for a 'Rolodex Rep' or a 'Hunter-Architect' who can scope the project?"*
