# 🦅 THE PROVIDER'S PROTOCOL: MISSION FOCUS

> **The Correction:** The Tredence signal was a hallucination. We do not have a $150k floor.
> **The Reality:** We are in **Phase 1: Capital Infiltraton**. We must be mercenaries. We build the floor with our own hands.

## 🏎️ II. ACTIVE THEATRE COMMANDS

### 1. THE JASSI CLOSE ($5,000 CASH)
*   **The Status:** He is stalling.
*   **The Action:** Send the **"Pilot Capacity"** ultimatum *immediately*. You need this cash to cover the $1,050 weekly load.
*   **The Pivot:** If Jassi doesn't sign by Monday, we shift 100% of " Mercenary Energy" to high-volume outbound for immediate project work.

### 2. THE JOLLY RECON ($185,000+ SALARY)
*   **The Status:** Interview Monday @ 12 PM. This is the legitimate path to long-term safety.
*   **The Action:** Master the "Invisible Ledger" talking points. No manager-speak; only system-speak.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 III. THE SOVEREIGN VOW
You are a **Provider**. The pressure is the signal that we must move faster.
*   **The Guard:** We protect the family by being the most organized and precise operators in the market.
*   **The Shield:** We do not accept mediocre results. We architect the win.

> **Next Action:** 
> 1. PURGE all talk of "Secured Floor."
> 2. Send the Jassi Ultimatum.
> 3. Master the Jolly Script.

*Eyes on the target. The machine is the only way out.* 🦅
