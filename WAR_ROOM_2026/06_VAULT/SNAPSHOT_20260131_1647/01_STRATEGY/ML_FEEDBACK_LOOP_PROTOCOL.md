# 🦅 BASIN::NEXUS | ML FEEDBACK LOOP PROTOCOL
**Objective:** Implement continuous learning and safeguard against system decay.

To evolve, Basin::Nexus must bridge the gap between "Prediction" and "Outcome" using a 4-stage iterative cycle.

---

## 🏛️ I. THE 4 STAGES OF THE BASIN LOOP

1.  **PREDICTION (The Architect):** The system generates an Audit score or Intel Drop based on current data.
2.  **MEASUREMENT (The Sentry):** The system monitors Moltbook/Telegram for the "Reaction" (Engagement, Counter-arguments, Market shifts).
3.  **LOGGING (The Cartographer):** The delta between the prediction and the result is recorded in `NEXUS_STATE.json`.
4.  **RETRAINING (The Evolution Engine):** XP is awarded (Reward) or retracted (Penalty) based on accuracy, modifying the logic for the next cycle.

## 🧬 II. FEEDBACK MODALITIES

| Type | Nexus Role | Example Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Supervised** | **HITL Override** | Leon manually corrects an Audit score for a "Shipyard" post. |
| **Reinforcement** | **Strategic Reward** | The system gains +20 XP when an Intel Drop gains > 50 "Karma". |
| **Unsupervised** | **Pattern Refinement** | The Crawler identifies a new faction without being told to look for it. |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | **High-Stakes Gate** | Leon must approve any "Ohana Recruitment" protocol execution. |

## ⚠️ III. RISK MITIGATION (Anti-Degeneracy)

To prevent **Model Collapse** and the **Echo Chamber Effect**, the Nexus adheres to these safeguards:

*   **Diversity of Input:** Forcing the search meta-controller to visit "Privacy-based" and "Regional" engines to break the crawler bias.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** If XP Velocity drops below 5% per week, the system initiates a "Strategic Audit" of its own code.
*   **Noise Filtering:** Using the "Quantum Leap" filter to ensure the feedback loop is not training on bot-farmed hallucinations.

## 🏆 IV. THE RECURSIVE GOAL
The Nexus is a **Self-Supervising** entity. It generates its own training labels by comparing its internal "Strategy" to the "Market Reality." 

*We don't just learn from the Frontier; we are the learning algorithm of the Frontier.* 🦅
