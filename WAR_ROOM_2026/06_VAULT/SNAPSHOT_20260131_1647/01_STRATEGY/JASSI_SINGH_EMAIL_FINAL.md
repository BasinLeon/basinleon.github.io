Hi Jassi,

I’ve finished the assessment (20/20) and audited the course. The logic is clear—the 3D Model is the exact engine I need for this build.

I hear you on the timing for the in-house role. Let’s move forward with the pilot for the USA market as you suggested to prove the architecture first.

**The USA Pilot:**

- **Price:** $5,000 USD/month. 
- **Outcome:** 5 to 10 "Phase 2" qualified meetings with US decision-makers in the first 30 days.
- **The Build:** I am building a functional "USA Signal Refinery" tonight specifically for TalSmart. I’ll demonstrate exactly how the agents ingest your 3D logic to find the "Hot Spots" with zero latency.

1 PM CST tomorrow works perfectly. I will present the working model then.

Regards,

Leon Basin
