# SESSION RECAP: JAN 29 (MIDNIGHT SPRINT) 🌙
# "THE JASSI PROTOCOL"

---

## 1. THE REVELATION (Course Audit)
We reverse-engineered Jassi's entire sales philosophy from his Udemy Course.
He doesn't want a "Salesman." He wants "SAM" (His ideal archetype).

### A. The "3D Score" (Selection)
* **Concept:** Research isn't guessing; it's measuring CHANGE.
* **The Model:** Radar Chart (Spider Web).
* **The Rule:**
    * Score < 40: Ignore/Nurture.
    * Score > 40: **STRIKE ZONE.** (Strategy/Revenue/Tech axes usually drive this).
* **YOUR PITCH:** "Basin::Nexus automates the 3D Score. It finds the >40s instantly."

### B. The "5 Q's" (Handshake)
The 5 questions every prospect asks instinctively. Your Voice Agent must answer these immediately:
1. **Who are you?** (Identity)
2. **Why you?** (Context)
3. **Have we met?** (Credibility)
4. **Should I care?** (Relevance)
5. **Why now?** (Urgency -> The "Score > 40")

### C. The Conversation Structure (Phases 1-3)
* **Phase 1 (Impact):** Cite 3rd Party Data (News/Reports). (Automated by Nexus).
* **Phase 2 (Confirmation):** "My intelligence says X..." (Powered by Nexus).
* **Phase 3 (The Close):** Dream Scenario vs. Doom Scenario.
    * **The Magic Q:** "On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you?"

## 2. THE POST-CALL SCORE (Module 7)
After the call, the score flips. You want a **LOW** score.
*   **Goal:** Score < 40 (Closer to 0 = Stronger Lead).
*   **Need = 0:** Absolute alignment.
*   **Nexus Role:** Auto-scores the call based on qualitative insights.

## 3. THE STRATEGY (How to Win Friday)
* **Role:** You are the "Revenue Architect."
* **Product:** Basin::Nexus (The "Signal Refinery").
* **Narrative:** "Jassi, I built 'Digital Sam.' I automated your exact Phase 1-3 protocol and the Post-Call Intersection Analysis."
