## 📊 THE APPROACH: Value-First, Not Pitch-First

### **Phase 1: Build Relationships (Weeks 1-4)**

**Daily (15 minutes):**
- Check #chat-help for questions you can answer
- Respond with actionable advice (no pitching)
- Share resources when relevant
- Build reputation as helpful expert

**Weekly:**
- Answer 3-5 questions with real value
- Share 1 insight or framework
- Engage in discussions authentically

**Monthly:**
- Build 3-5 meaningful relationships
- DM people you've helped
- Offer value (coffee chat, quick call, resource)

**Key Rule:** Give value for 4 weeks before asking for anything.

---

### **Phase 2: Strategic Content Sharing (Weeks 5-8)**

**When to Share Your Content:**
- ✅ Someone asks a question your content answers
- ✅ Discussion naturally leads to your expertise
- ✅ You've already provided value in the thread
- ✅ Someone explicitly asks for resources

**How to Share:**
- ❌ DON'T: "Check out my blog post about this!"
- ✅ DO: "I wrote about this exact problem. Here's the framework: [link]. Happy to discuss if helpful."

**Content to Share:**
1. "How I Replaced 10 SDRs" - When SDR/automation questions come up
2. "Architecture of Revenue" - When GTM strategy questions arise
3. "GTM Execution Dashboard" - When people ask about metrics/tracking
4. "Signal Engine" - When lead generation questions come up

---

### **Phase 3: Become Known Expert (Weeks 9-12)**

**By now you should:**
- Be recognized as helpful in the community
- Have 10+ people who know your expertise
- Have shared content naturally 5-10 times
- Built relationships with community leaders

**Then you can:**
- Offer to write guest posts for community blogs
- Propose speaking at community events
- Create content specifically for the community
- Become a go-to resource
