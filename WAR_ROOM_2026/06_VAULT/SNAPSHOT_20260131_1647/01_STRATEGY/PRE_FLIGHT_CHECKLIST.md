## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**If `python3 enrich_company.py` doesn't work:**
- Check: `python3 --version` (should be 3.7+)
- Check: `pip3 list | grep requests`
- Install: `pip3 install requests`

**If script errors:**
- It's okay - show the code structure, explain the logic
- Say: *"This is the architecture. The output demonstrates the principle."*

**If they ask to see the output:**
- The script may need a domain input - be ready to explain the architecture
- Focus on: *"This is how I think about data transformation"*

**You've got this. Go win.** 🏆
