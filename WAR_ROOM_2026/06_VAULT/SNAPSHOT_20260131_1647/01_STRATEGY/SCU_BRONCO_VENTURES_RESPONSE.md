Cristina and Kumar,

It's a pleasure to connect. I've just submitted the mentor application form.

As an EMBA alum ('23), I want to be as high-leverage as possible for the BVA startups. I'm currently building **Basin::Nexus**—a zero-latency GTM engine—and I'm happy to offer **"Architect Sessions"** for Prep School and Accelerator founders.

Specifically, I can help them move from "Flat GTM" to "Signal-Driven Sales" using the automation stacks I ship weekly.

I've drafted a session outline called **"The Signal Architecture Workshop"** that could work for Prep School Week 2 or Accelerator Week 4. Happy to share if useful.

I'll also mark Feb 26 for the BVA Café. Looking forward to meeting the community in the Lucas Lobby.

Best,
**Leon Basin**

## WHY THIS MATTERS

This email does three things:

1. **Positions you as specialized, not generic** — "Revenue Architecture for technical founders" is a category, not a service
2. **Seeds Basin::Nexus** — They'll Google it. They'll see your Substack. The flywheel spins.
3. **Asks a qualifying question** — Forces them to think about which founders need you RIGHT NOW

**This is what you ship daily/weekly/monthly:**
