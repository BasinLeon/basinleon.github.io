## 🚨 KEY LESSON FROM YOUR KRISTIE CONVERSATION

**What Happened:**
- You positioned yourself as a "builder" with "AI agents"
- She thought you were selling software
- You had to clarify: "I am the human applying for the role"

**The Lesson:**
- ❌ Don't lead with "I built AI agents" → Sounds like vendor
- ✅ Lead with "I'm a 15-year enterprise seller who automates my own prospecting" → Human first, builder second

**For Community Engagement:**
- ❌ "I built an AI system that..."
- ✅ "I'm a GTM leader who uses automation to..."
- ✅ "Here's what I learned from building systems that replaced 10 SDRs..."
- ✅ "I've found that automating prospecting lets me focus on..."

## 🎯 CONTENT DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY

### **When to Share Your Content:**

- Discussion naturally leads to your expertise
- You've already provided value in the thread
- Someone explicitly asks for resources

**❌ Bad Times:**
- First message in a thread
- No value provided first
- Unrelated to discussion
- Feels like self-promotion

### **How to Share:**

**❌ DON'T:**
- "Check out my blog post!"
- "I wrote about this: [link]"
- "Here's my tool: [link]"

**✅ DO:**
- "I wrote about this exact problem. Here's the framework: [link]. Happy to discuss if helpful."
- "I built a tool for this. Here's how it works: [brief explanation]. Link if you want to try it: [link]"
- "I documented my approach here: [link]. The key insight is [X]. Let me know if you want to discuss."
