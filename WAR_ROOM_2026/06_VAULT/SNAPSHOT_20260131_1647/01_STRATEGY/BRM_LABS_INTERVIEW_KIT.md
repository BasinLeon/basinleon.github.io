# 🧪 BRM LABS: GTM ENGINEER INTERVIEW BATTLE KIT (THE "MAD SCIENTIST" PLAY)

**Target:** James (Founder/CEO @ BRM Labs)
**Context:** Next step after an "incredible" conversation with Lane Hartman.
**Current Status:** Leon recovering from a bug, aimed for Jan 29/30 (Today is Jan 30).
**Objective:** Secure the GTM Engineer role by proving you can industrialize the "March Influx."

---

## 1. THE MISSION: INDUSTRIALIZING THE MARCH INFLUX
*   **The Problem:** 5,000 leads hitting in March from "Metrics" sponsorship.
*   **The Fear:** The team will "drown in manual toil" or miss the signal in the noise.
*   **The Solution:** You are building the **Signal Refinery** to process this volume instantly.

---

## 2. THE CORE THESIS: "VENDOR IDENTITY IS A DATA PROBLEM"
Leon, use this framing to distance yourself from "Sales Ops" and position as "Engineering":
*   "Most teams treat 5,000 leads as a sequence problem. I treat it as a **Data Enrichment & Scoring problem.**"
*   **The "Mad Scientist" Pivot:** "I'm not here to manage the BDRs; I'm here to build the machine that makes them 10x more effective."

---

## 3. THE BLUEPRINT (Q1 ARCHITECTURE)
*   **Phase 1: Ingest & Enrich**
    *   Run leads through the **Python Enrichment Agent**.
    *   **The "Tech Stack Signal":** Specifically looking for Brex/Coupa users to prioritize the top 10%.
*   **Phase 2: The "Watering Holes"**
    *   Pre-scraping attendee lists for Finance Dinners & SIG events.
    *   Identifying "Vendor Managers" at target accounts (e.g., **TD Ameritrade**) before physical arrival.
    *   *Script:* "We don't go to dinners to meet people; we go to dinners to close the people we already identified as high-intent."
*   **Phase 3: Dark Social Activation**
    *   Activating signals from Reddit/X to find the "Hidden Signal." (Referencing the Dark Social Case Study).

## 4. THE "TALK TRACK" FOR JAMES
*   **On the Role:** "Lane and I hit it off. He mentioned needing a 'Mad Scientist' for GTM experiments. That's exactly how I've built the **Basin::Nexus** architecture."
*   **On the Leads:** "I'm excited to show you how we can industrialize that March flow. We can turn those 5,000 leads into a prioritized strike list of 500 'Tier 1' accounts in under 4 hours using my Python stack."
*   **The Verdict:** "I'm ready to roll. Let's stand up the initial refinery for the TD Ameritrade target list next week."

## 5. INTERVIEW ASSETS
1.  **The `fit brm` Terminal Demo:** Show the "Ready to Deploy" verdict.
2.  **The Nexus Architecture Diagram:** (Noise -> Refinery -> Signal).
3.  **The Dark Social Case Study:** (Leon's Reddit/X signal extraction logic).

---

## 6. NEXT ACTIONS (IMMEDIATE)
1.  **Verify Meeting Status:** Did Tommy confirm the slot for Jan 30? (Window was 11:00 AM - 2:00 PM PST).
2.  **Prepare the "5,000 leads" Script:** Ensure `enrich_company.py` or similar is ready to demo a "mass enrichment" run.
3.  **Refine the PDF:** Ensure the "Q1 Architecture" PDF Leon sent Lane is open and ready for James.

**Remember:** You are the ARCHITECT. You are coming in to build a machine, not just run a process. 🦅
