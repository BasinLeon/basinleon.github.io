# 🚀 Automation Strategy: Path to $1M/Year

**Goal:** Automate 80% of workflow so you can focus on building something massive.

---

## 🎯 THE VISION

**Current State:**
- 30-minute daily manual protocol
- Tools disconnected (ROI Calculator, Pipeline Tracker, Dashboard, etc.)
- Repetitive tasks (job hunting, content, follow-ups)
- Manual data entry and tracking

**Target State:**
- 5-minute daily check-in
- All tools connected and automated
- Systems run themselves
- You focus on: Strategy, Closing, Building

**Revenue Target:** $1M/year through:
1. **Consulting/GTM Engineering** ($200K-300K)
2. **SaaS Product** (BASIN::NEXUS licensing) ($300K-400K)
3. **Content/Education** (Courses, Templates) ($200K-300K)
4. **Agency Model** (White-label GTM systems) ($200K-300K)
