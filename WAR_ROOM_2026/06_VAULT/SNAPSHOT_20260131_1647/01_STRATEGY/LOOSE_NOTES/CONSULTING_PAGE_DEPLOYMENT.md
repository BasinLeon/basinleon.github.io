# Consulting Page Deployment ✅

## Issue
The consulting page at `https://basinleon.github.io/consulting/index.html` was showing a 404 error.

## Root Cause
The `consulting/index.html` file was created locally but **not committed and pushed to GitHub**.

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Staged the `consulting/` directory
2. ✅ Committed with message: "Add consulting services page"
3. ✅ Pushed to `origin/main`

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Wait 1-2 minutes):
1. **Check GitHub Pages deployment:**
   - Go to your repository: `https://github.com/BasinLeon/basinleon.github.io`
   - Check the "Actions" tab for deployment status
   - Wait for the deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

2. **Verify the page works:**
   - Visit: `https://basinleon.github.io/consulting/`
   - Should now load successfully ✅

### If Still Not Working:

**Option 1: Force Refresh**
- Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)

**Option 2: Check GitHub Pages Settings**
- Go to repository Settings → Pages
- Ensure source is set to `main` branch
- Ensure `/ (root)` is selected

**Option 3: Check File Path**
- GitHub Pages is case-sensitive
- Ensure the URL is exactly: `/consulting/index.html` or `/consulting/`
- The file should be at: `consulting/index.html` in the repo
