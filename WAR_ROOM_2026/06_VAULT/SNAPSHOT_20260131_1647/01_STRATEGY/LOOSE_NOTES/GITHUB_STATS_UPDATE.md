# GitHub Stats Section Updated ✅

## What Changed

### ❌ Removed:
- Generic GitHub Stats API (showed C+ grade)
- GitHub Streak stats
- Top Languages chart (generic API)

### ✅ Added:
- **Technical Output** section with your actual achievements
- **83,000+ Lines of Code** (your real metric)
- **19 Public Repositories** (your actual count)
- **5 LLMs Orchestrated** (your technical depth)
- **10+ Live Tools** (your deployed work)
- **Language breakdown** with percentages and context

---

## Why This Is Better

### Before:
- Showed generic stats that didn't reflect your work
- C+ grade was misleading (you're a solo builder, not a contributor)
- Focused on GitHub activity, not output

### After:
- Shows your actual technical achievements
- Highlights what you've built, not just activity
- More impressive and accurate representation
- Professional metrics that matter
