# 📊 GTM EXECUTION PROOF - Interview Talking Points

**Real-world data from October 2025 GTM execution**

---

## 🎯 **FOR MASTECH (Revenue Architect Persona)**

### **The Headline:**
> "I don't just manage pipeline—I build systems that generate it. In 72 hours, I advanced 5 deals, generated 18+ new leads from experimental channels, and operationalized 4 repeatable plays."

### **Key Metrics:**
- **$621K Active Pipeline** across 25 opportunities
- **4 Meetings Booked** in 72 hours
- **18+ New Leads Generated** from experimental channels
- **5 Deals Advanced** with strategic plays
- **4 GTM Plays Operationalized** (Reddit Air Strike, SE Proactive Engagement, Call Blitz, Closed-Lost Campaign)

### **Pipeline Composition:**
- **Qualification:** 5 opps | $137,490 (22%)
- **Negotiation:** 3 opps | $85,039 (14%)
- **PoC:** 2 opps | $40,000 (6%)
- **Closed Lost:** 5 opps | $51,704 (8%)
- **Other / No Stage:** 10 opps | $307,403 (50%)
- **Total:** 25 opps | $621,636 (100%)

### **Talk Track:**
> "This is how I think about GTM execution. I don't just manage deals—I architect systems. The 'Reddit Air Strike' play started as an experiment. I generated 3 high-value leads, then systemized it with scripts and delegated it to the SDR. That's the same approach I'd bring to Mastech's Data Modernization practice: take raw data, structure it into actionable intelligence, and operationalize it at scale."

---

## 🛠️ **FOR BRM (GTM Engineer Persona)**

### **The Headline:**
> "I don't just execute—I build systems. I turn experiments into repeatable plays, then delegate them to scale."

### **Key Plays:**
1. **"Reddit Air Strike" Play:**
   - Generated 3 problem-aware leads
   - Systemized with tailored scripts
   - Delegated to SDR for execution
   - **Result:** One-off experiment → repeatable GTM motion

2. **X/Twitter Drippi Campaign:**
   - Generated 15+ technical conversations
   - Booked meeting with key influencer (Viktor Farcic, Upbound)
   - Nurtured one lead to proposal stage

3. **SE & SDR Enablement:**
   - Built "SE Proactive Engagement" play
   - Empowered technical teams to generate their own leads
   - **Result:** Distributed GTM execution, not just centralized

### **Talk Track:**
> "This is how I think: experiment → measure → systemize → scale. The 'Reddit Air Strike' play started as a 'secret shopper' experiment. I generated 3 high-value leads, then systemized it with scripts and handed it to the SDR. That's the same approach I'd use to build agentic workflows at BRM: build the system once, then let it run."

2. **Oct 20:** Jonathan offered availability, Leon navigated scheduling conflict professionally
3. **Oct 22:** Follow-up with multiple options, maintained momentum

**Talk Track for Mastech:**
> "This is how I manage strategic accounts. When I had a scheduling conflict with ManTech—a P0 FedRAMP opportunity—I didn't just cancel. I immediately offered multiple alternatives, maintained professional communication, and kept the deal momentum. This is the same approach I'd bring to Mastech's enterprise clients: persistent, professional, strategic."

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- ✅ **Professional Communication:** Clear, concise, value-focused
- ✅ **Strategic Persistence:** Didn't let scheduling conflicts kill momentum

## 💬 **INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS**

### **For Mastech:**
- "I think about GTM as Data Modernization. I take raw, messy pipeline data and structure it into actionable intelligence. This $621K pipeline isn't just managed—it's systemized."
- "The 'Reddit Air Strike' play is a perfect example: I took unstructured social signals, structured them into qualified leads, then operationalized the process. That's exactly what Mastech does with enterprise data."

### **For BRM:**
- "I build systems that scale. The 'Reddit Air Strike' play started as an experiment. I generated 3 leads, then systemized it and delegated it. That's how I think: build once, scale infinitely."
- "I don't just use agents—I build the workflows. This GTM execution data shows I think in systems, not just tactics."

---

## ✅ **USE THIS DATA WHEN:**

**Mastech:**
- Christopher asks about your process
- He asks about data skills or pipeline management
- He asks about strategic thinking

## 💬 **ENHANCED TALKING POINTS (With Timeline)**

### **For Mastech - Sustained Execution:**
> "This isn't just one week of execution—this is 3 months of consistent, high-velocity GTM. I grew the pipeline from $80K to $621K, maintained 500+ touches per week, and operationalized 6 different GTM plays. That's how I think about Data Modernization: take raw activity, structure it into systems, operationalize it at scale."

That's the same approach I'd use to build agentic workflows at BRM."

### **For Both - Long-Term Thinking:**
> "I think in systems, not tactics. Over 3 months, I didn't just hit numbers—I built infrastructure. SDR program, playbook library, conversion systems, channel frameworks. That's the difference between activity and architecture."

- **July 28:** Converted conference connection → booked meeting with Verified Credentials
- **Result:** Built channel framework from market signals, not just executed existing program

### **GTM Tech Stack Evaluation:**
- **Problem:** Data vendor 50%+ inaccurate
- **Solution:** Final vendor bake-off (ListKit, RocketReach, Clay)
- **Decision:** Data-driven choice, not just picking cheapest

### **Content & Webinar System:**
- **Created:** "Zero Blind Spots" webinar system
- **Multi-Channel:** Email, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Sales Nav
- **Conversion:** 5-touch sprint, meeting factory
- **Result:** Built complete content → pipeline system

## 💬 **ENHANCED TALKING POINTS (The Full Journey)**

### **For BRM - Building Systems:**
> "I didn't just execute—I built the system from scratch. In July, I hired the first SDR and invested 10 hours in shadowing and setup. I created the playbook, installed auto-logging, built discovery rubrics, and created dashboards. By October, that system was generating 450+ touches per week and I had operationalized 6 different plays. That's how I think: build the infrastructure, then scale. That's the same approach I'd use to build agentic workflows at BRM."

### **For Mastech - Strategic Building:**
> "This isn't just execution—this is strategic system building. I grew the pipeline from $134K to $621K over 4 months, but more importantly, I built the infrastructure: SDR program, playbook library, data hygiene processes, multi-channel systems. That's how I think about Data Modernization: take raw activity, structure it into systems, operationalize it at scale."

### **For Both - The Full Picture:**
> "I think in systems, not tactics. Over 4 months, I didn't just hit numbers—I built infrastructure. SDR program from scratch, playbook library, data hygiene processes, multi-channel systems, discovery rubrics, dashboards. That's the difference between activity and architecture."
