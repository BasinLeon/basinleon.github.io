## 🎯 POSITIONING REMINDERS

**Remember from Kristie conversation:**
- ❌ DON'T: "I built AI agents that..."
- ✅ DO: "I'm a GTM leader who uses automation to..."

**In This Intro:**
- "I've been building revenue systems for 15+ years"
- "Built systems that replaced 10 SDRs" (not "I sell AI agents")
- "GTM and Revenue Architect" (not "AI builder" or "vendor")
- "I code in my spare time" (shows technical, but not leading with it)

**Human first, builder second. Value first, pitch never.**
