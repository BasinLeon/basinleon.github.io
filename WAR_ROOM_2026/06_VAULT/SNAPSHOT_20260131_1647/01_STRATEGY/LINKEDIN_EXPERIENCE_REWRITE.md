# 🦅 LINKEDIN EXPERIENCE OVERHAUL (2026)

## 🚨 THE DIAGNOSIS
Your core experience is solid, but the *framing* is too "Activity-Based" (e.g., "Led strategy," "Managed team").
We need to switch to "Builder-Based" framing (e.g., "Architected," "Engineered," "Deployed").

---

## 🏗 ROLE 1: BASIN::NEXUS (The Builder Hook)
*Current:* Good, acts as a consultancy.
*Tweaks:* Keep it exactly as is. It's strong because it uses "Shipped" terminology.
**Status: APPROVED.**

---

## 🛡 ROLE 2: FUDO SECURITY (The Pivot Point)
*Current:* "Led Americas GTM strategy..."
*Critique:* Sounds like a standard Sales Manager. We need to sound like a TAM/Engineer.

**✅ REWRITE (Copy/Paste):**
**Title:** Senior Manager, GTM Strategy & Technical Partnerships
**Description:**
"Hired to run Sales; pivoted to building the GTM Architecture.
• **Engineered the Partner Mesh:** Rebuilt the dormant channel program by implementing technical enablement tracks, resulting in 160% pipeline growth targeting ISO/SOC2 compliance sectors.
• **Technical Deal Rescue:** Personally deployed as the 'Fixer' on stalled Enterprise PoCs, bridging the technical gap between Client CISOs and Engineering to close 6-figure contracts.
• **Zero Trust Evangelism:** Translated complex PAM/Zero Trust architecture into business value for C-Level buyers across NA & LATAM."

---

## 🧠 ROLE 3: SENSE (The Scale Hook)
*Current:* "Managed high-performing BDR team..."
*Critique:* "Managed" is passive. "Orchestrated" is active.

**✅ REWRITE (Copy/Paste):**
**Title:** Group Manager, Global Business Development (GTM Systems)
**Description:**
"Orchestrated the transition from 'Manual Outreach' to 'Social Selling at Scale.'
• **System Architecture:** Designed the 'Social Selling' playbook that integrated LinkedIn triggers with Outreach.io, increasing response rates by 125%.
• **Pipeline Engineering:** Managed the BDR engine that generated $10M in pipeline, focusing on signal-based routing rather than volume-based spam.
• **Retention Logic:** Built automated workflow triggers to detect churn risk, reducing customer attrition by 12%."

---

## 📊 ROLE 4: SURVEYMONKEY (The Enterprise Hook)
*Current:* "Enterprise Business Development..."
*Critique:* Good logo, needs more "Solutioning."

**✅ REWRITE (Copy/Paste):**
**Title:** Enterprise Business Development (Strategic Accounts)
**Description:**
"Strategic hunter for the Enterprise tier.
• **Solution Selling:** Partnered with Solution Engineers to map complex feedback data workflows for Fortune 500 clients.
• **Signal-Based Outbound:** Pioneered early 'intent-based' prospecting methods, leveraging IPO and hiring signals to break into key accounts."

---

## 📉 THE LOWER ROLES (Sanho, Google, NetApp)
*Strategy:* These are less critical. Leave them as they are to show longevity.

**🦅 ACTION PLAN:**
1.  **Update Fudo:** Use the "Technical Deal Rescue" framing.
2.  **Update Sense:** Use the "System Architecture" framing.
3.  **Update SurveyMonkey:** Use the "Solution Selling" framing.

This aligns your history with the "TAM / GTM Engineer" narrative.
