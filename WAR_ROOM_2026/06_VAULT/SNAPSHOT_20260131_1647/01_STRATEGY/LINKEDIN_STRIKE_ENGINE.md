# LINKEDIN STRIKE ENGINE (Algorithm Tuning)
## THE "POCKET OPERATOR" PROTOCOL

### 1. THE "NO-LINK" RULE
- **CRITICAL:** Never put an external link (basinleon.github.io) in the main post body. The algorithm treats it as "Leave the platform" and suppresses it.
- **EXECUTION:** Mention the link exists, then post it as the **FIRST COMMENT** immediately after publishing.

### 2. THE DWELL TIME HOOK
- **The "See More" Button:** The first 3 lines must force a click.
- **Hook Format:** "I was wrong about [Industry Standard]." OR "[High Number] was replaced by [Low Number]."
- **Example:** "Stop hiring for activity. Start architecting for signal."

### 3. THE VISUAL MATRIX (In Order of reach)
- **Rank 1: PDF Carousels.** Treat these as "Executive Briefs." (e.g., your 3-slide prompt).
- **Rank 2: Native Video.** You talking for 60 seconds about the "Refinery."
- **Rank 3: One Single High-Status Image.** The "War Room" photo.

### 4. THE FIRST HOUR SPRINT
- **Signal Integrity:** Reply to the first 5 comments within 10 minutes. This tells the algorithm the post is "Live."
- **The "Operator" Reply:** If someone comments "SIGNAL," reply with "Sent the map to your DMs." (Then actually send it).

### 5. THE BILINGUAL KEYWORDS
Always include at least 2 from each category:
- **Category A (Recruiter Search):** *Director, Revenue Operations, GTM Systems, Pipeline, CAC, ROI.*
- **Category B (Founder Status):** *Architect, Refinery, Zero-Latency, Pivot, Sovereignty.*
