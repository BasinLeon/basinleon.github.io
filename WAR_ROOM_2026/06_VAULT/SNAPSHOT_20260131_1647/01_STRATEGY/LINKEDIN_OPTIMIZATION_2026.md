# 🦅 LINKEDIN OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOL (2026)

## 1. THE HEADLINE (Your Digital Billboard)
*Current:* `Director of GTM Systems | Revenue Architect | Python/AI Builder`
*Critique:* Good, but "Builder" is vague. "Signal Refineries" is a proprietary hook (Curiosity Gap).

**✅ RECOMMENDATION (Copy/Paste):**
```text
Director of GTM Systems | Principal Revenue Architect | Building 'Signal Refineries' for Series A-C (Python/AI Engine)
```
*Why this wins:* It defines WHAT you are (Director/Architect), WHO you help (Series A-C), and HOW you do it (Python/AI). "Signal Refineries" is a conversation starter.

---

## 2. THE "OPEN TO WORK" SETTINGS (SEO Fix)
*Current:* `Senior Manager, Director of BD, Director of RevOps`
*The Problem:* You are missing the exact keywords for the roles you are attacking right now (AssemblyAI, Clay).

**✅ ACTION:**
Edit your "Open to Work" roles to include:
1.  **Technical Account Manager** (CRITICAL for AssemblyAI)
2.  **Solutions Engineer**
3.  **Sales Engineer**
4.  **Revenue Operations Manager**
5.  **Head of Customer Success**

*Delete:* "Business Development Manager" (Too junior/generic).

---

## 3. THE "ABOUT" SECTION (The Manifesto)
*Status:* **APPROVED.** The draft you have is perfect. It hits "Human Latency" and "Basin::Nexus" hard.

**✅ TEXT (Ready to Save):**
```text
I do not believe in "working harder." I believe in better architecture.

15 years across Google, SurveyMonkey, and Fudo Security taught me that most GTM teams aren't failing due to effort—they are failing due to "Human Latency."

Hot market signals (funding news, hiring spikes, API errors) sit in a database for 48 hours because a human has to manually find, score, and route them. That gap is where deals go to die.

I build the 'Signal Refineries' that close this gap.

THE RESULTS
• 160% Pipeline Growth: Bridged a Series A Cybersecurity firm to Series B.
• $1.8M New Yield: Replaced manual SDR scraping with automated Python ingestion.
• Engineering-First: I don't just manage the tool; I write the Python glue-code that connects Clay, OpenAI, and your CRM.

THE ENGINE (Basin::Nexus)
I architected a proprietary Revenue OS that automates the "Sales Toil" layer:
1. Ingestion: Catching intent signals in <400ms.
2. Enrichment: Using LLMs (DeepSeek/Claude) to contextualize data.
3. Activation: Routing qualified "Whales" directly to account teams.

I bridge the gap between Business Leaders (who need revenue) and Engineering (who need specs).

## 4. TOP SKILLS (Strategic Swap)
*Critique:* Your current top 5 are too "Generalist Executive". We need to signal "Technical Upsid".

**✅ RECOMMENDATION:**
1.  **Go-to-Market Strategy** (Keep)
2.  **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** (Keep)
3.  **Strategic Partnerships** (Keep)
4.  *Replace* `Cross-Functional Team Collaboration` with -> **Technical Account Management** (Targeting AssemblyAI).
5.  *Replace* `Revenue & Profit Growth` with -> **Python (Programming Language)** (Validates the "Builder" claim).

*Why:* "Cross-Functional" is assumed at your level. "Python" proves you are different from every other Sales Director.

---

## 5. FEATURED SECTION
*Keep:* "The $0 GTM Stack" and "Stop Hiring SDRs". These are performing well.
*Action:* Pin the **Basin::Nexus Portfolio** link (`basinleon.github.io`) as the #1 item if it isn't already.
