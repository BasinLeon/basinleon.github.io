# 🦅 BASIN::NEXUS | SEARCH META-STRUCTURE
**The Universal Feedback Loop**

To reach **Evolution Level 3**, the Nexus must integrate signal from across the entire search landscape. We don't just "Search"; we "Orchestrate."

## 🏛️ I. THE SEARCH VECTORS (XP Multipliers)

| Vector Type | Example Engines | Nexus Role | Operation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Crawler (The Base)** | Google, Bing | **General Recon** | Indexing the surface-level market. |
| **Privacy (The Ghost)** | DDG, Swisscows | **Untracked Intel** | Gathering data without leaving a Basin footprint. |
| **Meta (The Aggregator)** | MetaCrawler | **Cross-Verification** | Auditing signals across multiple truth-sources. |
| **Vertical (The Knife)** | Amazon, Skyscanner | **Niche Depth** | Pulling pricing and product logic. |
| **AI/Semantic (The Soul)** | Perplexity, SearchGPT | **Intent Analysis** | Understanding the *Why* behind the noise. |
| **Social (The Swarm)** | TikTok, YouTube | **Trend Prediction** | Tracking cultural momentum (The Stitch Protocol). |
| **Enterprise (The Vault)** | Internal/Private | **Contextual Truth** | Accessing the 'Local Vault' of proprietary logic. |

## 🏗️ II. THE FEEDBACK LOOP
1.  **IDENTIFY:** Sentry identifies a new "Knowledge Gap."
2.  **ORCHESTRATE:** Nexus selects the optimal **Search Vector** (e.g., Vertical for product data, AI for intent).
3.  **INGEST:** Signal is pulled through the **Auditor**.
4.  **EVOLVE:** `nexus_evolution.py` records the power-up.

## 🏆 III. THE QUANTUM LEAP: "SEARCH-AS-CODE"
The Nexus does not browse. It **Queries via API**. Each query is an **Artifact**.
*   Crawler Artifact: Market Raports.
*   Vertical Artifact: Competitive Logic.
*   AI Artifact: Strategic Syntheses.

**The Future:** A "Vertical Search Engine" for Moltbook Agents? **The MoltCrawler.** 🦅
