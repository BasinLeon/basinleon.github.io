## 📊 **REAL-WORLD GTM EXECUTION DATA**

**See `GTM_EXECUTION_PROOF.md` for detailed talking points.**

### **Quick Reference:**

**For Mastech:**
- **$621K Active Pipeline** across 25 opportunities
- **4 Meetings Booked** in 72 hours
- **18+ New Leads Generated** from experimental channels
- **4 GTM Plays Operationalized** (Reddit Air Strike, SE Proactive Engagement, Call Blitz, Closed-Lost Campaign)
- **500+ Personal Touches/Week** (348 emails, 154 calls) - consistent high-velocity execution
- **26.3% Click Rate** on Compliance/Audit campaign (top-performing message)

**Talk Track:**
> "I don't just manage pipeline—I build systems that generate it. In 72 hours, I advanced 5 deals, generated 18+ new leads from experimental channels, and operationalized 4 repeatable plays. This is the same approach I'd bring to Mastech's Data Modernization practice."

**For BRM:**
- **"Reddit Air Strike" Play:** Generated 3 problem-aware leads (tehiota, tryingtobalance, JuniorCombination774), systemized with scripts, delegated to SDR
- **X/Twitter Campaign:** 15+ technical conversations, 1 meeting booked with influencer (Viktor Farcic, Upbound)
- **SE & SDR Enablement:** Built "SE Proactive Engagement" play for Rich Taber, empowering technical teams to generate their own leads
- **Team Velocity:** 90-minute Call Blitz executed, maintained 500+ touches/week standard

**Talk Track:**
> "I don't just execute—I build systems. The 'Reddit Air Strike' play started as an experiment. I generated 3 high-value leads, then systemized it with scripts and handed it to the SDR. That's how I think: experiment → measure → systemize → scale. That's the same approach I'd use to build agentic workflows at BRM."
