# COURSE AUDIT: PREDICTIVE PROSPECTING (JASSI SINGH)
**Auditor:** Leon Basin
**Date:** Jan 29, 2026
**Status:** Audit Complete. Opportunity Confirmed.

## 1. THE CORE FRAMEWORK: "The 3D Business Model"
Jassi teaches a manual scoring system to identify high-propensity buyers based on **CHANGE**.

### The Scoring Logic (0-10 Scale)
*   **0-4 (Status Quo):** "Perfectly fine, no need to buy." (Dead Lead).
*   **5-7 (Friction):** "Things are annoying." (Warm Lead).
*   **8-10 (Crisis/Opportunity):** "Huge shift happening." (Hot Lead).

### The "Spider Web" Visualization (Radar Chart)
Jassi visualizes this as a **Radar Chart (Spider Web)** with 8 axes:
1.  **Strategy** (Global Expansion?)
2.  **Revenue** (Losses? Growth?)
3.  **Technology** (Migration? Legacy?)
4.  **Organization** (Hiring? Layoffs?)
5.  **Product** (New Launch?)
6.  **Competition** (New Entrants?)
7.  **Political** (Leadership Change?)
8.  **Culture** (Morale?)

### The "Deep Dish" Case Study (The Whale)
*   **Strategy (8):** Going Global.
*   **Revenue (9):** Lost $200k/weekend (Crisis).
*   **Technology (9):** Moving to Proprietary (Migration).
*   **Organization (7):** Understaffed.
*   **Total Score:** **43** (The Threshold is 40).

### The "Hot Spot" Rule
*   **Score < 40:** "Keep Digging / Nurture."
*   **Score > 40:** "Strike Now." (Position as the 'Ultimate Sidekick').
*   **Key Insight:** The "Hot Spots" are the axes furthest from the center (8s and 9s). Pitch *only* to those pains.

## 4. MODULE 4 & 5: EXECUTING THE OUTREACH (CRAFTING THE MESSAGE)
Jassi highlights "Sam" (the ideal rep) who does three things *before* dialling:
1.  **Engages Publicly:** Comments on the CIO's interview (Warmer).
2.  **Collaborative Crafting:** Doesn't write alone. Uses Marketing + Coach.
3.  **The "5 Q's" Methodology:**
    *   Who are you? / Why you? / Have we met? / Should I care? / Why now?
    *   *Automation:* Our Voice Agent uses these 5 Q's as the "Handshake Protocol."

---

## 5. MODULE 6: THE CALL SCRIPT (PHASES 1-3)
Jassi breaks the perfect call into 3 phases. We automate the *Prep* for all 3.

*   **Phase 1 (Impact):** Cite a 3rd Party Source (News/Report).
    *   *Nexus:* Auto-fetches the "Pizza Monthly" equivalent.
*   **Phase 2 (Confirmation):** Validate the pain. "My system shows X..."
    *   *Nexus:* Provides the "Intelligence Dossier" on screen for the rep.
*   **Phase 3 (The Future/Pain Close):**
    *   "Scenario A (Dream) vs Scenario B (Doom)."
    *   **The Magic Question:** "On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you?" -> If <9, disqualify.
    *   *Nexus:* Can transcribe the call and auto-score the commitment level (Sentiment Analysis).

---

## 2. THE GAP (The Opportunity)
Jassi is teaching humans to be "Detectives" and manually gather clues to calculate this score.
*   *Input:* Read News, Read Interviews, Check Stocks.
*   *Process:* Mental Math (0-10 Scale).
*   *Output:* Pitch or Pass.

**The Problem:** This is slow. Humans get tired. They miss the "Revenue Dip" news or the "CIO Interview."

## 3. THE SOLUTION (Basin::Nexus Automation)
We do not change the methodology. We **digitize** it.

**The Pitch to Jassi:**
"Jassi, I love the 3D Model. It's brilliant. But asking an SDR to manually check 50 accounts a day to see if 'Technology' moved from a 5 to a 9 is impossible. They will miss the signal."

**The Product (Slight Adjustment):**
My 'Signal Refinery' is actually a **'3D Score Calculator.'**
1.  **Ingest:** It reads the "CIO Interview" (Just like Aiden in the case study).
2.  **Score:** It tags "Strategy Change: High" (Score = 8).
3.  **Alert:** It calculates Total Score = 43.
4.  **Route:** It alerts the Rep: "Dr. Deep Dish is a 43. Call now."

---

## 4. MODULE 7: POST-CALL INTERSECTION (LEAD QUALITY)
After the call, the 3D Model logic *inverts*. We now measure **Friction/Gap** to determine if we should move to Qualification.

*   **The Scale:** 0 (Critical/Known) to 10 (Unknown/No Fit).
*   **The Ideal Lead:** Total Score **< 40**. (Closer to 0 is better).
*   **Need/Problem = 0:** This is the highest priority.
*   **The Workflow:**
    1. **Pre-Call (Market Signal):** Score > 40 is HOT.
    2. **Post-Call (Deal Fit):** Score < 40 is HOT.

## 🔥 SUMMARY FOR JASSI DEMO
*   **The Hook:** "I built 'Digital Sam.' I automated your exact Phase 1-3 protocol."
*   **The Proof:** "Nexus allows a Rep to see the 'Sales Intersection Point' in real-time based on the 3D Model criteria."
*   **The Close:** "On a scale of 1-10, are you committed to seeing your framework inside every revenue team?"
