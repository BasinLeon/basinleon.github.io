## Meeting: Tomorrow @ 1:00 PM CST (11 AM PT)

---

## 1. 🎯 THE OBJECTIVE
**Primary Goal:** Close the $5,000 Month-to-Month Pilot (USA Market).
**Key Message:** "I built the system that automates your manual 3D Prospecting model."
**The Win:** Stability ($5k/mo) + Proof of Concept (Lead Gen Results).

## 2. 🕵️ INTELLIGENCE DOSSIER (Simulated)
* **Name:** Jassi Singh
* **Role:** Likely VP Sales / CRO / Head of Revenue (Assumption based on context)
* **Pain Point:** Lead decay. His team is calling leads 48 hours late.
* **Psychology:** Wants to feel "ahead of the curve" but fears operational complexity.

## 3. 🗣️ THE NARRATIVE ARC (The 30-Minute Architecture Brief)

### Phase 1: The Visual Anchor (The "Engine Room") (5 min)
*   **Action:** Screen Share `GTM_SIGNAL_REFINERY_DIAGRAM.png` (Full Screen).
*   **The Script:**
    *   "Jassi, I audited your course. I know you teach the **3D Model** for prospecting."
    *   "You teach Reps to manually calculate if a Score is >40. That takes hours."
    *   "**Basin::Nexus automates the 3D Score.**" (Point to 'Signal Refinery' on diagram).
    *   "It scans Strategy, Revenue, and Tech signals. It only routes leads with a Score > 40."
    *   "My system filters the Noise, Refines the Signal, and delivers the Gold."
    *   **"But diagrams are cheap. Let me show you the machine running live."**

### Phase 2: The Live Proof (Telegram Bot) (5 min)
*   **Action:** Switch to Terminal + Telegram Window.
*   **The Script:**
    *   "I don't use dashboards. I use **Intelligence Agents**."
    *   "Watch as I audit your own company right now."
*   **The Command:** Type `analyze coretus` into the bot.
*   **The Result:** (The bot will instantly output the analysis: "Revenue Leak Detected", "Competitor Signal", "Action Plan").
*   **The Punchline:** "That analysis took 4 seconds. Your SDR takes 4 hours. That is the difference."

### Phase 3: The Close (The "Sam" Protocol) (5 min)
*   **The Scenarios:**
    *   "Scenario A (Dream): We install Nexus. You capture the Vietnam/Tech leads instantly."
    *   "Scenario B (Doom): We don't. They sit for 48 hours. You lose the market."
*   **The Magic Question (Jassi's favorite):**
    *   "On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to solving this lead decay *this quarter*?"
*   **The Offer (If he says 9 or 10):**
    *   "Great. I deploy the pilot in 48 hours. $2,500 flat. We prove the lift or you unplug it."

## 4. ⚔️ OBJECTION HANDLING

**"Is this just another wrapper around ChatGPT?"**
* "No. It's an autonomous agentic architecture. ChatGPT chats. Nexus *orchestrates*—it touches your CRM, your calendar, your email, and your phone simultaneously."

**"It looks technical. Can my team use it?"**
* "Your team never sees the code. They just get the alerts on their phone/Slack/WhatsApp. It's zero-UI for them."

**"How much?"**
* "For the pilot: $2,500 flat. We deploy in 48 hours."
