**Content Types:**
- Screenshots of tools with captions
- "Before/After" metrics graphics
- Carousel posts explaining frameworks
- Stories: Day-in-the-life of a Revenue Architect

**Hashtags:**

## 📊 CONTENT REPURPOSING WORKFLOW

## 🔥 LAUNCH POSTS (Use these NOW)

### Tool Launch Post (LinkedIn)
```
Just shipped 3 free GTM tools:

💰 ROI Calculator - See how much you'd save replacing SDRs with automation
📋 Case Study Generator - Create deployment strategies in seconds  
💼 Headline Generator - LinkedIn headlines that actually get clicks

No sign-up. No API costs. Just value.

Try them: basinleon.github.io/tools/

What tool should I build next?

#GTM #RevenueOps #FreeTools
```

### Portfolio Announcement (X)
```
After 15 years in GTM, I built everything I wish existed:

• Career intelligence OS (React + 5 LLMs)
• ROI calculator for SDR replacement
• Case study generator (4 frameworks)
• LinkedIn headline optimizer

All free. All open source.

basinleon.github.io

What would you add?
```

### Authority Post (LinkedIn)
```
In 2024, I helped a cybersecurity company grow pipeline 160% without hiring a single new SDR.

How?

Signal Architecture.

Instead of "more calls = more deals," we built:
• Intent signal monitoring (50k/day)
• AI-powered lead scoring
• Auto-generated personalized outreach

The result: Same team, 2.6x output.
