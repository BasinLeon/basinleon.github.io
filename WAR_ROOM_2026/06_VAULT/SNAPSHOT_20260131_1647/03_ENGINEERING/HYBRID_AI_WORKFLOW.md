# 🦅 THE COMPLETE AI WORKFLOW GUIDE
## Using Antigravity (Me) + Continue (Local) Together

---

## 🎯 THE STRATEGY: USE BOTH

**Think of it like this:**
- **Antigravity (Me)** = Your strategic partner, architect, teacher
- **Continue (Local)** = Your coding assistant, always available, FREE

**You don't replace one with the other. You use BOTH strategically.**

---

## 🔄 WHEN TO USE EACH

### Use ANTIGRAVITY (This Chat) For:

**1. Strategic Planning**
- "What should I build next?"
- "How do I architect this system?"
- "What's the best approach for X?"

**2. Learning & Teaching**
- "Explain how X works"
- "Teach me about Y"
- "What's the difference between A and B?"

**3. Complex Multi-Step Tasks**
- "Set up my entire AI infrastructure"
- "Build me a complete system with fallbacks"
- "Create a workflow that does X, Y, and Z"

**4. File Operations**
- Creating multiple files
- Editing across your workspace
- Running terminal commands
- Installing software

**5. Big Picture Thinking**
- "Review my entire strategy"
- "What am I missing?"
- "How does this all fit together?"

---

### Use CONTINUE (VS Code) For:

**1. Quick Coding Questions**
- "Write a function that does X"
- "Fix this bug"
- "Explain this code"

**2. In-File Editing**
- Highlighting code and asking "improve this"
- "Add error handling here"
- "Refactor this function"

**3. Autocomplete**
- It suggests code as you type (like Copilot)
- Tab to accept suggestions
- FREE unlimited

**4. Rapid Iteration**
- "Try this approach"
- "Now do it differently"
- "Add this feature"

**5. When You're Already Coding**
- Don't switch contexts
- Ask Continue directly in VS Code
- Keep your flow

## 💡 THE HYBRID WORKFLOW

### Example: Building a New Feature

**Step 1: Plan with Antigravity (Me)**
```
You: "I want to build a Telegram bot that uses my local AI"
Me: [Explains architecture, creates files, sets up structure]
```

**Step 2: Code with Continue (VS Code)**
```
- Open the files I created
- Ask Continue: "Add error handling to this function"
- Ask Continue: "Write tests for this"
- Use autocomplete as you code
```

**Step 3: Review with Antigravity (Me)**
```
You: "Review my Telegram bot code"
Me: [Checks all files, suggests improvements, updates docs]
```

**Step 4: Iterate with Continue (VS Code)**
```
- Make the changes
- Ask Continue for quick fixes
- Keep coding
```

## 🎯 REAL EXAMPLES

### Scenario 1: "I need to write a Python function"

**FAST WAY (Continue):**
- Open VS Code
- Type in chat: "Write a function to calculate Fibonacci"
- Get answer instantly (FREE)
- Keep coding

**LEARNING WAY (Antigravity):**
- Ask me: "Teach me about Fibonacci and show me 3 different approaches"
- I explain the concepts
- I create example files
- You understand WHY, not just HOW

---

### Scenario 2: "My code has a bug"

**QUICK FIX (Continue):**
- Highlight the buggy code
- Ask Continue: "What's wrong here?"
- Get instant fix
- Move on

**DEEP DEBUG (Antigravity):**
- Share the error with me
- I analyze your entire codebase
- I find the root cause
- I teach you how to prevent it

---

### Scenario 3: "I want to build a new project"

**ARCHITECTURE (Antigravity):**
- "I want to build X that does Y"
- I design the system
- I create all the files
- I set up the infrastructure
- I write the docs

**IMPLEMENTATION (Continue):**
- Open the files I created
- Fill in the details with Continue
- Ask for specific functions
- Use autocomplete to speed up

**POLISH (Antigravity):**
- "Review everything and make it production-ready"
- I check all files
- I add error handling
- I update docs
