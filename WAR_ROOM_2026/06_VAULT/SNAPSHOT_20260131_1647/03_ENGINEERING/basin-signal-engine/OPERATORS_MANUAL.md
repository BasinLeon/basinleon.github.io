3. **Enter the Dojo:** Go to **Boardroom Simulator** → Set target to **"Skeptic CFO"**
4. **Execute the Swarm:** Deploy challenge:
   > *"Your 160% growth is noise. How would you justify a $220k salary to our CFO?"*
5. **Critique & Repeat:** Drill until **XP Score** hits 150+

| Objection | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| *"Why did you leave?"* | "I completed my mission—160% pipeline growth. The next chapter requires a larger canvas." |
| *"No direct experience in X"* | "My systems are industry-agnostic. The methodology transfers—40% CAC reduction proves it." |
| *"Why you over tenure?"* | "Tenure measures time; I measure impact. $10M pipeline in 18 months." |
| *"Tell me about a failure"* | "I relied on activity over architecture. Now I build once, scale infinitely." |
| *"What's your weakness?"* | "Over-engineering. I've learned to ship MVPs fast, then iterate." |
