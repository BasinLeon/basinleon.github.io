# 🦅 PROJECT: STRUCTURAL STRIKE ENGINE (BUILD 01)

**Status:** AUTOMATION ACTIVE
**Objective:** Replace standard "Applications" with "Sovereign Blueprints."

## 🏛️ I. THE ARCHITECTURE (Logic Gates)

1.  **GATE 01: THE INHALE (Scraping)**
    *   **Source:** Job Boards (Ashby/Greenhouse), TrueUp (Layoffs), or LinkedIn (Signals).
    *   **Action:** Scraping the JD and Company "Mission" text.

2.  **GATE 02: THE REFINERY (Diagnosis)**
    *   **Filter 1 (Decision Science):** Identify the "Assessment Void" or "Feedback Decay" in their current GTM motion.
    *   **Filter 2 (Cybernetics):** Identify where the "O-rings" are failing (Manual SDR work, high latency).
    *   **Filter 3 (Psychology):** Map the "Identity Shift" from Candidate to Architect.

3.  **GATE 03: THE EXHALE (The Strike)**
    *   **Format:** HTML/Markdown "Structural Blueprint."
    *   **Call to Action:** Direct bypass of ATS -> Hiring Manager Hard Close.

## 🏛️ II. TEST CASE 01: VANTA (GTM ENGINEER AI)

**Diagnosis:** [AUTO-GENERATING...]
*   **The Problem:** Vanta is building AI-governance but using manual GTM o-rings to sell it. (Logic: Cybernetic Mismatch).
*   **The Fix:** Deploying the **Nexus::Refined Ledger** to automate the compliance-to-revenue signal chain.
*   **Asset:** [STRIKE_VANTA_ARCH_BLUEPRINT.html]
