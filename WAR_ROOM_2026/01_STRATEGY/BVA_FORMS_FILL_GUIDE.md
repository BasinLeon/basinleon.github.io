### Additional Information (THE HOOK)
```
I'm currently building Basin::Nexus—an open-source, zero-latency GTM engine for early-stage founders. I specialize in helping technical founders move from "flat architecture" (treating all leads the same) to "signal-driven sales" (prioritizing high-value opportunities in real-time).

I'm happy to offer "Architect Sessions" covering:
1. The Signal Leak Audit — Diagnosing where leads decay in your funnel
2. The Whale vs. Minnow Framework — Prioritizing outreach based on enrichment data
3. Zero-Latency Routing — Building automated systems that work while you sleep
