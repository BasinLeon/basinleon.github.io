## 💡 Pro Tips

- **If script takes time:** That's fine - it shows real work happening
- **If they ask to see code:** The file is right there, you can `cat enrich_company.py`
- **If they want output:** It creates `enriched_companies.json` automatically
- **If something breaks:** Show the architecture, explain the logic - that's what matters
