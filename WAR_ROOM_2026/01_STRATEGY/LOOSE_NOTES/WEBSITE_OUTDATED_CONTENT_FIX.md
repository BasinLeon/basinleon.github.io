# Website Outdated Content - Issues Found

## ❌ Outdated Content in Screenshot

### 1. **Hero Headline** (CRITICAL)
**Screenshot Shows:**
```
I Don't Just Sell Tech—
I Build AI Agents
```

**Should Be:**
```
I Build Revenue Systems
That Scale Revenue, Not Teams
```

**Status:** Code is correct, but site may not be deployed or cached

---

### 2. **Hero Subtitle** (POTENTIAL ISSUE)
**Screenshot Shows:**
```
Now I build autonomous systems that automate research, prioritization, and outreach—so I spend human time on the close.
```

**Current Code Shows:**
```
I code what I architect. Systems that multiply impact without multiplying headcount.
```

**Status:** Need to verify which is correct

---

### 3. **CTA Buttons** (MINOR)
**Screenshot Shows:**
- "SEE RESULTS"
- "LET'S TALK"  
- "RESUME"

**Current Code Shows:**
- "📄 Download Resume"
- "💼 Let's Talk"
- "🔧 Consulting Services"

**Status:** Current version is better (more professional)

---

### 4. **Metrics Display** (VERIFY)
**Screenshot Shows:**
- Large metrics: 160%, $2M+, 5, 15+, $621K
- Small metrics above: 160% Pipeline Growth, $424K Annual Savings, 5 Days SDR Ramp

**Current Code Shows:**
- Stats row with: $424K, 160%, 5 Days, 83K+

**Status:** Need to verify if $2M+ and $621K should be more prominent
