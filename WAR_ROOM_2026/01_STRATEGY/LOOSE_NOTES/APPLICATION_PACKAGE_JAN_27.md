# 🚀 APPLICATION PACKAGE: THE "BIG 5" (Focus: OpenAI & GitHub)
**Date:** Jan 27, 2026
**Strategy:** "The Builder" // "The GTM Engineer"

---

## 1. OpenAI (Role: Product GTM / Solutions)

**Subject Line:** Building the Revenue Feedback Loop.

**Cover Note / Intro DM:**

> "I don't just sell the model; I build with it.
>
> Most GTM leaders wait for Engineering to ship features. I taught myself Python so I could build my own revenue agents using GPT-4 and Llama.
>
> Over the last 2 years, I architected 'BASIN::NEXUS'—an autonomous GTM OS (83k+ lines of code)—that orchestrated 5 LLMs to replace a 10-person SDR team with just myself and an API key. I didn't just read the documentation; I lived it.
>
> I am applying to OpenAI because GTM for AI isn't about slide decks anymore; it's about **RLHF for Revenue**. The sales team should be the highest-fidelity feedback loop for the model. I speak both languages: I can close a $250k enterprise deal, and I can debug the Python script that sourced it.
>
> 
> *   **System Built:** [basinleon.github.io](https://basinleon.github.io)
> *   **Code:** [github.com/BasinLeon](https://github.com/BasinLeon)
>
> Let's build the engine."

**Resume Tweak strategy:**
*   **Move "Technical Skills" to the very top**, right under the generic header.
*   **Emphasis:** "Key Metrics" -> Orchestrated 5 LLMs.

## 2. GitHub (Role: Enterprise Sales / strategic)

**Subject Line:** A Seller who lives in VS Code.

**Cover Note / Intro DM:**

> "How many of your Enterprise Reps have 19 public repositories and 83,000 lines of code pushed?
>
> I am your target persona. I am a 15-year Enterprise Sales Leader who got tired of manual workflows, so I used **GitHub Copilot** to teach myself how to code.
>
> I built 'Project Sentinel' (a full GTM automation suite) entirely in VS Code, using GitHub for version control and Actions for deployment. I didn't just learn the tool; I used it to replace a 10-person SDR team and generate $23M in pipeline.
>
> When I talk to a CTO or a VP of Engineering, I don't just recite feature lists. I open my terminal. I show them my commits. I show them how GitHub is the nervous system of my entire revenue operation.
>
> I want to sell GitHub because I *am* the success story you're trying to replicate."

**Resume Tweak strategy:**
*   **Hyper-link GitHub Profile:** Make it massive.
*   **Experience:** Frame "Fudo Security" role as "Git-Ops for Sales."
