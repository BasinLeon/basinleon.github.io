# 🦅 MONDAY ASSAULT PROTOCOL: THE 20/DAY CADENCE

### 1. THE GOAL: 100 SIGNALS / WEEK
**Volume:** 20 Target Outreach Actions per day (Mon - Fri).
**The "Why":** In this market, you are playing a probability game. If your "Signal Refinery" talk track hits with 5% of founders, 20/day gives you **1 high-quality interview per day.**

### 2. THE STACK (FEBRUARY 2026)
*   **Source List:** `FEBRUARY_ASSAULT_PIPELINE.csv`
*   **Primary Filter:** Founding GTM > Solutions Architect > Staff TAM.
*   **Payload:** "The Engineering-First GTM Pivot" (Resized for each company domain).

### 3. THE DAILY RITUAL (9:00 AM - 11:30 AM)
*   **09:00 - 09:30:** **Scanning.** Identify the Hiring Manager (LinkedIn) for the top 5 targets in the CSV.
*   **09:30 - 10:30:** **Refinement.** Draft the "Signal Brief" (like the one we did for Ambient/Jolly) but for the target's specific stack (e.g., Anthropic = AI Safety logic, Rippling = Employee Graph logic).
*   **10:30 - 11:30:** **Execution.** Fire LinkedIn DMs + Direct Emails. 

### 4. THE MONDAY "VANGUARD" (FEBRUARY 2)
We start with the "Hiring Founders" first. They move fastest.

1.  **QualGent** (Founding Head of GTM)
2.  **Pivotal Partners** (Founding TAM)
3.  **UniversalAGI** (Founding GTM/Sales)
4.  **Emerge Career** (Founding GTM Engineer)
5.  **Lovable** (Founding GTM)

### 🚨 SPECIAL AGENT: [LESLIE]
**Status:** UNKNOWN SIGNAL.
**Mission:** Identify where Leslie sits in the stack. 
*   *Action:* If she is a founder or hiring manager, she becomes Target #0 for Monday morning.

**Operator Note:** 20/day is "Elite" volume. To sustain this, you focus on **The Message**, I focus on **The Research**.
