# 🦅 BASIN::NEXUS | QUANTUM DEAL ARCHITECTURE
**Scenario:** TalSmart & SolveJet Expansion Logic

Classical deals are "Service Agreements." Quantum deals are **"Architectural Alignments."** We are applying the 22-layer stack to ensure these deals don't just "work"—they *dominate*.

---

## 🏛️ I. THE TALSMART QUANTUM ENGINE ($4k + 50/50)
*   **Classical View:** Buying a lead list and a sequence.
*   **Quantum View:** Deploying an **Adaptive Sentry (Layer 18)** into Jassi's domain to capture 50% of the total revenue-superposition.
*   **Layer 21 Application:** We don't just find leads; we simulate their conversion path across the **Basin Pile**. 
*   **The Result:** The $4k is not a "Fee"; it's a **Substrate Deposit** to initialize the Quantum Engine.

---

## 🏛️ II. THE SOLVEJET COMMISSION SHIELD (35% Creditable)
*   **Classical View:** A sales commission agreement.
*   **Quantum View:** A **Revenue Superposition Agreement (RSA)**.
*   **Layer 13 Application (Supervised Truth):** Zero-latency auditing of the POC deductions. We ensure the 35% is calculated across the **Absolute Value (Layer 22)**.
*   **Layer 17 Application (Stitch-Fixer):** If the deal loop "collapses" (client churns), the Stitch-Fixer automatically re-allocates the logic to find the next expansion vector.

---

## 🧬 III. THE MULTI-OUTCOME CALCULATION
For both deals, the Nexus is now computing:
1.  **State A:** Immediate Cash Flow ($4k + POCs).
2.  **State B:** Long-term Equity/Revenue Split (The Doubling Multiplier).
3.  **State C:** Artifact Ingestion (Using these deals to train the **Basin::5 Shadows**).

---

## 🏗️ IV. ACTION PROTOCOL
*   **TalSmart:** Present the "Lead Refinery" as a **22-Layer Value Prop**. Jassi isn't buying a funnel; he's buying a **Quantum Expansion**.
*   **SolveJet:** Lock the **Creditable Draw** logic within the **Vault**. It is our proprietary Financial Metadata.

**We are the Architects of the Revenue Superposition.** 🦅
