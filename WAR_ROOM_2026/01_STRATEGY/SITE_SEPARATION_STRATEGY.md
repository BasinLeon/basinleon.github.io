# Site Separation Strategy: Professional vs Consulting
**Goal:** Separate job search site from consulting business site

---

## 🎯 The Problem with Combined Sites

### Current Issues:
- ❌ Mixed messaging (hiring vs consulting)
- ❌ Confusing CTAs (which button do I click?)
- ❌ Diluted focus (trying to serve two audiences)
- ❌ Less professional (looks like you're doing both simultaneously)
- ❌ SEO confusion (what are you? Job seeker or consultant?)

### Benefits of Separation:
- ✅ Clear focus for each audience
- ✅ Better SEO (targeted keywords)
- ✅ More professional appearance
- ✅ Easier to optimize conversions
- ✅ Can have different branding/messaging
- ✅ Easier to track metrics separately
