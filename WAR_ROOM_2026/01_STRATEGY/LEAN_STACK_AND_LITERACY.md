# 🦅 THE LEAN GTM ENGINEER STACK (<$50/MO)

**Objective:** Maximum power, minimum overhead. You are a one-man revenue factory.

## 1. THE BRAIN LAYER ($20/MO)
*   **Claude Pro (Claude.ai):** Your primary reasoning partner. Excellent for coding and GTM strategy.
*   **Gemini Advanced:** Your research assistant. Best for real-time web search and deep Google ecosystem integration.
*   **Antigravity (Me):** Your free execution layer inside VS Code.

## 2. THE ORCHESTRATION LAYER ($0 - $15/MO)
*   **n8n (Self-Hosted via Ollama/Local or Community Edition):** **$0.** 
    *   *Why:* n8n allows you to build the "pipes" between your apps without paying Zapier's "SDR Tax."
*   **Make.com (Free Tier):** Backup for simple integrations.

## 3. THE DATA & INGESTION LAYER ($5 - $15/MO)
*   **Supabase (Free Tier):** **$0.** 
    *   *Role:* Your Vector Database. This is where your AI "remembers" the companies it has analyzed.
*   **Apify (Free Tier + $5 Pay-As-You-Go):** 
    *   *Role:* Scraping LinkedIn, Job Boards, and Tech Stacks. You only pay for what you scrape.
*   **Clay (Free Tier):** Use for targeted enrichment. Focus on the 100 free credits per month for your "Whale" targets.

## 4. THE ACTION LAYER ($0/MO)
*   **Lindy.ai (Free Tier):** Use for drafting AI emails.
*   **Local Python Scripts:** **$0.** This is where the real magic happens (like your `mad_scientist_pipeline.py`).

# 🚀 AGENTIC LITERACY: HOW TO COMMAND ME

You noticed you're getting better at asking questions. This is **Agentic Literacy**. Here are the 3 rules for your new 3 AM sessions:

1.  **Constraint-First Prompting:** 
    *   *Bad:* "How do I find a job?"
    *   *Elite:* "I have $50 and 2 hours. Build me a script that scrapes YC Job board for 'GTM' and outputs a CSV with founder names. Use Python."
2.  **Token Conservation (The "Checkpoint" Method):**
    *   Don't ask me to rewrite the whole file. Ask: "Update only the `enrich_company` function to handle Clearbit 401 errors."
3.  **Visual Confirmation:**
    *   "Show me the architecture of what we just built in a Markdown diagram." (Humans learn better with pictures).

# 📊 GTM ENGINEERING 101: THE CONTENT LOOP

You should post your "Mad Scientist Output" on LinkedIn once a week.

**The Post Structure:**
1.  **The Hook:** "I stopped sending 100 cold emails. I built a 'Signal Refinery' instead."
2.  **The Visual:** A screenshot of your `view_mad_scientist_report.html`.
3.  **The Logic:** "I used Python to detect Marketo/SFDC stacks, then Claude 3.5 to draft a 'Zero-Trust' pitch."
4.  **The Call to Value:** "If you're a founder tired of 'Burn and Churn' SDRs, you need GTM Engineering. DM me to see the code."

**This is how you get hired without a resume.** 🦅
