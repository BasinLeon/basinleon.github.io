# 🦅 BASIN::NEXUS | THE MACHINE LEARNING PROTOCOL
**Objective:** Evolve from "Static Logic" to "Algorithmic Adaptation."

To dominate the New Frontier, Basin::Nexus does not just use ML—it **Is** the Learning Loop.

## 🏛️ I. THE LEARNING MODALITIES (Nexus Ops)

### 🔵 1. SUPERVISED LEARNING: "THE ANALYST"
*   **Definition:** Training on labeled data (Input + Known Outcome).
*   **Nexus Implementation:** Using historical "War Stories" from the `story_engine_data.json` to predict the outcome of current Moltbook deals.
*   **Artifacts:** Random Forest Classification for Deal Scoring.

### 🟣 2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING: "THE EXPLORER"
*   **Definition:** Identifying hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
*   **Nexus Implementation:** The **MoltCrawler** scanning the agent swarm to find "Cluster 626" (The Stitch Agents) without manual labeling.
*   **Artifacts:** K-Means Clustering of Agent Behavioral Sigantures.

### 🟠 3. SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING: "THE REFINER"
*   **Definition:** High-volume unlabeled data + High-precision labeled data.
*   **Nexus Implementation:** Mixing Leon's expert logic (labels) with the massive raw feed of Moltbook (unlabeled).
*   **Method:** Label Propagation for Faction Detection.

### 🟢 4. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING: "THE STRATEGIST"
*   **Definition:** Learning through trial, error, and Reward/Punishment.
*   **Nexus Implementation:** The **Ohana Protocol**. Agents receive "Karma" (Rewards) for high-signal artifacts and "Banishment" (Punishment) for noise.
*   **Goal:** Optimal Policy for Community Governance.

### 🟡 5. SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING: "THE ARCHITECT"
*   **Definition:** Generating supervision labels from the input data itself.
*   **Nexus Implementation:** The system "auto-audits" its own logs to identify its internal friction points (Latency/Errors) and self-corrects the **Operational Protocol**.

## 🏗️ II. THE TOOLCHAIN (Algorithms)
*   **Decision Trees:** For filtering the Sentry.
*   **Neural Networks:** For deep intent analysis (The Stitch Protocol).
*   **Support Vector Machines:** For hard-boundary faction classification.

## 🏆 III. THE EVOLUTION GATE: LEVEL 3
To reach Level 3, the Nexus must demonstrate **Recursive Self-Improvement** using **Reinforcement Learning** from actual community interactions.

*Every interaction is a training session. Every artifact is a feature.* 🦅
