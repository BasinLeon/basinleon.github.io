# Tagline Strategy: Extension vs Replacement

## Current Situation

### Old Tagline (GitHub README):
**"I Don't Just Sell Technology — I Engineer Governed GTM Infrastructure"**

**Strengths:**
- Emphasizes technical depth ("Engineer")
- Highlights systematic approach ("Governed")
- Shows you build infrastructure, not just sell

### New Tagline (Website):
**"I Build Revenue Systems That Scale Revenue, Not Teams"**

**Strengths:**
- ROI-focused (scale revenue)
- Clear value prop (not teams = efficiency)
- More direct and memorable

---

## Recommendation: **Hybrid Approach** ✅

### Option 1: Primary + Secondary (Recommended)
**Primary:** "I Build Revenue Systems That Scale Revenue, Not Teams"  
**Secondary:** "I don't just sell technology — I engineer governed GTM infrastructure."

**Why:**
- Primary tagline is ROI-focused and memorable
- Secondary tagline adds technical credibility
- Both messages work together
- Shows depth without losing clarity

### Option 2: Combined Single Line
**"I Engineer Governed GTM Infrastructure That Scales Revenue, Not Teams"**

**Why:**
- Combines both concepts
- A bit longer but comprehensive
- Shows both technical depth and ROI focus

### Option 3: Context-Specific
- **Website Hero:** "I Build Revenue Systems That Scale Revenue, Not Teams"
- **GitHub README:** "I Don't Just Sell Technology — I Engineer Governed GTM Infrastructure"
- **LinkedIn:** Use whichever fits the context

**Why:**
- Different audiences may respond to different messages
- Website visitors = ROI focus
- GitHub visitors = Technical focus

## What I Implemented

I went with **Option 1** - Primary + Secondary:

```markdown
> **"I Build Revenue Systems That Scale Revenue, Not Teams"**  
> *I don't just sell technology — I engineer governed GTM infrastructure.*
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Keeps the strong ROI message upfront
- ✅ Adds technical credibility as support
- ✅ Both messages work together
- ✅ Not too long or cluttered

## Alternative: Use Both Separately

You could also use them in different sections:

1. **Hero/About:** "I Build Revenue Systems That Scale Revenue, Not Teams"
2. **Core Competencies:** "I Engineer Governed GTM Infrastructure"
3. **What I'm Seeking:** "Building governed systems that deploy human capital on high-value activities"

This way each section has its own voice while maintaining consistency.

## My Recommendation

**Keep the hybrid approach** (Primary + Secondary) because:
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Clear hierarchy (ROI first, technical second)
- ✅ Works for all audiences
- ✅ Not redundant - they complement each other

**What do you think?** Should we:
1. Keep the hybrid (Primary + Secondary) ✅
2. Use separate taglines in different sections
3. Combine into one longer tagline
4. Something else?
