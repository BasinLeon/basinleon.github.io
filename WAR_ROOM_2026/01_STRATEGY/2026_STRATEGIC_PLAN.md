## 📱 LINKEDIN STRATEGY

### Profile Updates (Do This Week)

**Current About (Has Private Info):**
> "$1.8M Yield" / "Fudo" mentioned

**New About Section (Privacy-Aligned):**
```
I build revenue systems that eliminate sales toil and shorten "human latency."

15 years across Google, SurveyMonkey, and NetApp taught me that more "activity" isn't the answer. The answer is better architecture.

I build the bridge that closes the 40-hour gap where hot market signals sit untouched because teams are drowning in noise.

The Results:
• 160% Pipeline Growth: Bridged a Series A Cybersecurity firm to their Series B.
• Significant Yield: Built a bifurcated GTM model that replaced manual labor with automated discovery.
• Validation: I don't just build the machine; I get on the phone and validate the messaging myself.

The Machine (BASIN::NEXUS): I architected a proprietary Revenue OS (Python/LLMs) that handles lead scoring and signal detection so humans can focus on the close.

The Mission: Seeking a Director-level leadership role where the goal is to scale a commercial engine through systems thinking and signal integrity.
