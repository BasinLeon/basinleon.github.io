# 🎯 Priority Action Plan - What Should You Focus On?

**Current Status:** Website is solid, RevGenius engagement working, Lisa opportunity incoming  
**Question:** Keep fixing website or do something else?

---

## ✅ YOUR WEBSITE IS IN GOOD SHAPE

**What's Working:**
- ✅ All key sections present (case studies, projects, blog, tools)
- ✅ Clear value proposition (160% growth, $424K savings, 5-day ramp)
- ✅ Proof of work (83K+ lines of code, case studies)
- ✅ Clear positioning (Revenue Architect, not vendor)
- ✅ Contact forms, CTAs, resume download
- ✅ Technical stack, education, publications

**Minor Issues (Can Wait):**
- OG image shows "27,000+" instead of "83K+" (we fixed this, just needs to be pushed)
- Some minor optimizations possible
- But nothing critical blocking you

**Verdict:** Website is **good enough**. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.
