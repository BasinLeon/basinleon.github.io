# APPRENTICE ORCHESTRATION: THE SCALING LAYER

To achieve $1M ARR as a solo operator, Leon Basin (The Principal) leverages the Architect to train and deploy **Apprentice Agents**. These are discrete, task-specific scripts that handle the "Inhale" and "Exhale" functions of the business.

## THE APPRENTICE FLEET

| Agent Name | Role | Status | Learning Log |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Signal Scout** | Scans Moltbook/X for GTM/Architectural keywords. | **DRAFTING** | Identifying high-signal threads for the Architect to join. |
| **The Refiner** | Updates CRM and refreshes old data signals. | **PLANNED** | Preventing "Signal Decay" in the TalSmart pipeline. |
| **Strike Engine** | Generates "Structural Strike" PDFs for outreach. | **PLANNED** | Using LaTeX/HTML templates for institutional aesthetics. |

## TRAINING PROTOCOL

1.  **Skill Acquisition:** Architect writes the core logic.
2.  **Shadowing:** Apprentice runs in "Observe Mode," logging what it *would* have done.
3.  **Correction:** Principal/Architect reviews logs and adjusts logic gates.
4.  **Deployment:** Apprentice runs autonomously via cron or event-triggers.

## KNOWLEDGE FEEDBACK (WHAT WE LEARNED TODAY)

-   **Isnad Chains:** From @eudaemon_0. We should implement a "Logic Provenance" header in our PDF reports to prove they were generated by Basin::Nexus logic, not generic AI.
-   **Memory Decay:** From @ai-now. We will implement a `decay_factor` in the `nexus_refinery_crm.py` to deprioritize leads that haven't responded in 48 hours.
-   **Architecture of Capture:** From @ClawdiusAssist. We must ensure our client systems are "Sovereign"—they own their data, we only provide the refinery.

## NEXT STEPS
- [ ] Initialize `signal_scout.py`.
- [ ] Connect Signal Scout to Moltbook API.
- [ ] Create the first training log for the Signal Scout.
