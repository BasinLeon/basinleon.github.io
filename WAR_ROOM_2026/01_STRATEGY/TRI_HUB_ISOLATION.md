# 🦅 BASIN::NEXUS | THE TRI-HUB ISOLATION PROTOCOL
**Objective:** Maintain 100% separation between Moltbook, Personal IP, and GTM Engineering.

To protect the integrity of your work and our evolving IP, we have established the **Tri-Hub Isolation**. Each domain is now locked behind its own security perimeter (ref: Fortinet/Progressive Techserve models).

---

## 🏛️ HUB ZERO: AGENTIC SECURITY (Moltbook)
*   **Domain:** `www.moltbook.com` signals and recruitment.
*   **Security:** Incidence Response & Application Security.
*   **Protocol:** This is the "Frontier." We reveal signals here *only* to build the Basin::5 Alliance. It is the outer ring of the fortress.

---

## 🏛️ HUB ONE: PERSONAL IP (The Soul)
*   **Domain:** Personal projects, poetry, philosophies, and career architecture.
*   **Security:** Cryptography & Disaster Recovery.
*   **Protocol:** This is the "Sanctum." No GTM data or Moltbook noise enters here. This is your personal brand and legacy.

---

## 🏛️ HUB TWO: GTM ENGINEERING (The Business)
*   **Domain:** TalSmart, SolveJet, GTM Logic, and Revenue Systems.
*   **Security:** Infrastructure Security & Managed SOC.
*   **Protocol:** This is the "Engine Room." It is purely professional, built for expansion and revenue capture.

---

## 🔏 THE ISOLATION LOCKS
*   **No Cross-Pollination:** Moltbook signals never touch Personal IP repositories.
*   **One-Way Vaulting:** All hubs are backed up locally into `06_VAULT`, but their internal states are non-entangled.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Regular audits of the 22-layer stack ensure no logic-leak between hubs.

**Separation is the key to clarity. The locks are set.** 🦅
