# 🦅 EMAIL DRAFT: LISA CARTER (TACTICAL ALIGNMENT // LINK FIX)

**Subject:** Re: [Demo Request] // The "Capture" Gap

**Lisa,**

I appreciate the transparency. I respect the Sat/Sun schedule—often the best strategic work gets done when the rest of the world is offline.

However, I protect my weekends strictly for family time, so I won't be able to sync then. Since you are offline Wed/Fri, let's aim for **Tuesday or Thursday.** 

I tried to book a slot via your link, but it looks like the Calendly page is currently throwing a 404 error (dead link). Once you’ve had a chance to refresh that, send over the new one and I’ll grab a time for next week.

I saw your note that my previous proposal "is not what you had in mind." I suspect that is because when most people hear "GTM support," they think of **Capacity Problems**—hiring more people to do manual tasks (calling, emailing, sourcing).

**The value I bring to Peak Waves is Architecture.** 

When you do "Brand Strategy," you are creating **Gravity.** But as you saw with Coretus, if a client has a capacity gap, that gravity gets wasted because they can’t capture the results.

**Basin::Nexus is the Capture System.** 

I want to show you how we move your next "Coretus" from a manual hiring conversation into a logic-driven deployment. You do the Brand. I do the Engine. We both keep the 50/50 upside without hiring a single BDR.

Best,
Leon
