## ✅ VERIFICATION

**All blog posts have been:**
- ✅ Scanned for private information
- ✅ Cleaned of company names
- ✅ Cleaned of personal names
- ✅ Cleaned of specific metrics that could identify clients
- ✅ Cleaned of exact dates
- ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub

---

## 📋 REMAINING GENERIC REFERENCES (SAFE)

These are generic enough to be safe:
- "Series A Cybersecurity Company" (too generic to identify)
- "$424K savings" (public metric, already on site)
- "160% pipeline growth" (public metric, already on site)
- "10 SDRs → 2 SDRs" (public metric, already on site)
- Generic industry descriptions

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Case Study Metrics:** The "$424K savings" and "160% growth" metrics are already public on your main site and case studies page, so they're safe to keep.

2. **Generic Company Descriptions:** "Series A Cybersecurity Company" is generic enough that it doesn't identify a specific company.

3. **Script Names:** "enrich_company.py" is a generic script name and doesn't reveal private information.

4. **Framework Names:** "BASIN::NEXUS", "Nexus Engine" are your own product names, so they're safe.

No private information remains that could:
- Identify specific clients
- Reveal confidential business details
- Expose personal information
- Create legal liability
