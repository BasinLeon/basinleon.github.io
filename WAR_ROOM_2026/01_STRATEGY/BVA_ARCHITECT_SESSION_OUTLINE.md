## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Most early-stage founders hit the same wall:

> "We have product-market fit, but we can't systematize revenue."

They try to solve this by:
- Hiring SDRs too early (burns cash)
- Buying sales tools they don't need (complexity without clarity)
- Running founder-led sales forever (doesn't scale)

**The real problem:** They have **Flat Architecture**—treating every lead the same, regardless of value.

## 🏗️ What Founders Will Learn

### Module 1: The Signal Leak Audit (30 min)
*Diagnose where your GTM is losing money*

- How to identify "lead decay" in your current funnel
- The 48-hour void: why speed-to-contact matters more than message
- Exercise: Map your current lead flow from first touch to first meeting

**Outcome:** Each founder leaves with a visual "Signal Leak Map" of their business.

---

### Module 2: The Whale vs. Minnow Framework (30 min)
*Stop treating all leads equally*

- How to define "Whale" criteria for YOUR business (not generic rules)
- The enrichment stack: Clay, Apollo, Prospeo—which one, when, and why
- Live demo: Watch a lead get classified in <200ms

**Outcome:** Each founder defines their Whale/Dolphin/Minnow criteria on paper.

---

### Module 3: Zero-Latency Routing (20 min)
*Build the system that works while you sleep*

- The n8n/Make.com orchestration layer (visual, no-code)
- Connecting webhooks to enrichment to Slack alerts
- When to call vs. when to automate

**Outcome:** Founders understand the architecture; ready to implement.

---

### Module 4: Office Hours (10 min)
*Personalized Q&A*

- Hot-seat: One founder shares their funnel, I audit it live
- Open questions from the group
