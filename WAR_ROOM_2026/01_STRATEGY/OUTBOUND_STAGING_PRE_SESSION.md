# OUTBOUND STAGING: JAN 29, 2026 (PRE-DR. ANA SESSION)

## 1. WIFE (SMS/TELEGRAM)
"Oh baby, I just saw the MRI notes. I am so sorry you’re dealing with that pain. A labrum tear and bursitis is no joke—no wonder you’ve been hurting. I’m so sorry I’ve been so buried in my head while you’re going through this. Please just rest. I’ve got the girls tonight—I’ll handle the pickup and bedtime so you don't move that shoulder at all. Quick update: The Chairman (Jassi) replied and agreed to a USA Pilot. I’m proposing a $5,000/mo retainer to start immediately. It's the stability we need. I’ll do a late push tonight once the girls are asleep to finish the demo, but for now, I’m all yours. Love you."

**Subject:** Re: Predictive Prospecting & Partnership Roadmap
"Hi Jassi, I've completed the assessment (20/20) and audited the course. The logic is crystal clear—the 3D Model is the exact engine I’ve been looking for. Regarding the USA Pilot: 1. The Cost: $5,000 USD/month month-to-month retainer. 2. The Outcome: We target 5-10 'Phase 2' qualified meetings with US-based decision-makers in the first 30 days. 3. The Clarification: I’m building a functional 'USA Signal Refinery' tonight specifically for TalSmart. I will demonstrate exactly how the agents ingest your 3D logic to find the 'Hot Spots' with zero latency. 1 PM CST tomorrow works. I will present the working model then. Regards, Leon"
