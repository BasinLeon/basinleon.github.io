# Hybrid Website Strategy: Hiring Managers + Consulting Clients
**Goal:** One website that serves both audiences with clear paths

---

## 🎯 The Hybrid Approach

### Core Philosophy
**"I build revenue systems that deliver ROI — and I code them myself."**

This works for:
- ✅ Hiring managers (sees ROI + technical capability)
- ✅ Consulting clients (sees ROI + systems thinking)
- ✅ Thought leaders (sees innovation + execution)

## 🏗️ Website Structure: Dual Pathways

### HERO SECTION (Works for Both)
**Lead with ROI, prove with code**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SYSTEM ONLINE // v10.0 // 83,000+ Lines Deployed      │
│                                                          │
│  I Build Revenue Systems That Replace Headcount         │
│                                                          │
│  $424K Annual Savings | 160% Pipeline Growth | 5-Day Ramp│
│                                                          │
│  [For Hiring Managers] [For Consulting Clients]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Stats (Above the Fold):**
1. **$424K Annual Savings** (ROI - works for both)
2. **160% Pipeline Growth** (Results - works for both)
3. **5 Days SDR Ramp** (Efficiency - works for both)
4. **83,000+ Lines Built** (Proof - works for both)

## 🎯 Audience Segmentation Strategy

### Option 1: Clear CTAs (Recommended)
**Two buttons in hero that route to different sections:**

```
[👔 For Hiring Managers] [💼 For Consulting Clients]
```

**Hiring Managers Path:**
- → "Why Hire Me" section
- → Career timeline with metrics
- → Technical proof (code, systems)
- → Resume download
- → Contact form (role-specific)

**Consulting Clients Path:**
- → Case studies (detailed)
- → Services/offerings
- → ROI calculator
- → Tools marketplace
- → Contact form (project-specific)

### Option 2: Smart Routing (Advanced)
**Based on referrer or user selection:**

- LinkedIn/Job board → Hiring manager experience
- Direct/Organic → Balanced experience
- Tools page → Consulting client experience

### Option 3: Unified with Clear Sections
**One page, clearly labeled sections:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FOR HIRING MANAGERS                │
│  [Section with hiring-focused content]│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FOR CONSULTING CLIENTS             │
│  [Section with client-focused content]│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
