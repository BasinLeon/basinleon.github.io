## 1. THE "CHALLENGER" HOOK (The CEO's Obsession)
**Context:** Dean Zimberg (CEO) is obsessed with the concept of "Normalization of Deviance" from the Challenger disaster.
*   **The Talk Track:** "Most GTM teams suffer from 'Normalization of Deviance.' They accept a 0.05% reply rate as 'normal' because they've been doing it for years. I build **Safety Systems** (Signal Refineries) that ensure we only launch campaigns when the O-rings are sealed—meaning the signal is high and the timing is perfect."

## 2. THE "TEMPORAL DISCOUNTING" HOOK
**Context:** Dean writes about the decay of incentives over time.
*   **The Talk Track:** "Incentives die in the void. If a frontline worker (or a BDR) takes an action and doesn't see a result for 48 hours, the dopamine hit is gone. My **Basin::Nexus** architecture is built to close that gap. We detect a signal and trigger a mission in **5 minutes**, not 5 days. We solve for Temporal Discounting."

## 3. THE "NINTENDO" FEEDBACK LOOP
**Context:** Jolly wants workers to feel like they are in a game.
*   **The Talk Track:** "I treat GTM like a Nintendo game loop. Input -> Instant Feedback -> Reward. Most companies treat it like a DMV queue. I'm here to build the engine that makes outbound feel like a high-stakes mission for the reps."

## 4. THE "MASTER OF COIN" (Zach Kirkhorn)
**Context:** Their lead investor was the CFO of Tesla. 
*   **The Talk Track:** "I respect that Zach Kirkhorn is on the board. He understands **Vertical Integration.** That’s my approach to GTM. I don't just 'use tools'; I build a vertically integrated refinery where data flows directly into execution without human latency."

## KILLER QUESTIONS FOR TREVOR (Reverse Interview)
1.  "Trevor, you're the first GTM Engineer here. Where is the **Normalization of Deviance** currently creeping into the sales motion? What are we accepting as 'normal' that we shouldn't?"
2.  "With the Series A capital, we are moving from 'Founding Playbook' to 'Scale.' How does the **Referral Kernel** need to evolve to support 100k+ workers?"
3.  "Zach Kirkhorn is on the board—how much of the **Tesla 'Engineering First' culture** is reflected in the way you guys approach data workflows?"
