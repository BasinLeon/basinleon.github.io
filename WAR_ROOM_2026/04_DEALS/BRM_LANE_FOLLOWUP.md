**Subject:** Industrializing the March Influx / Quick Update

Hi Lane,

I’m finally coming up for air after being sidelined by a bug earlier this week. I wanted to send a quick note to let you know I’m fully back in "Mad Scientist" mode and looking forward to the conversation with James.

I've been refining the logic for that **March Lead Flow** we discussed. There is so much leverage in those 5,000 sponsorship leads if we hit them with the right enrichment layer (specifically targeting the Brex/Coupa/Tier-1 signals) before the team ever touches them.

I'm also ready to show James how we can operationalize the "Watering Hole" strategy for the upcoming Finance Dinners—pre-fetching the vendor manager identities so we aren't just networking, but executing.

I'll be coordinating with Tommy to get the Founder conversation on the books for early next week.

Have a great weekend!

Best,

Leon
