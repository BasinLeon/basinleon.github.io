# 🦅 2026 OPPORTUNITY WAR ROOM: THE PIPELINE

## 1. THE TOP PRIORITY: JOLLY.COM
*   **Status:** Interview with Trevor Pang (GTM Engineer).
*   **When:** Monday, Feb 2 @ 12:00 PM PT.
*   **The Deal:** $180k OTE + Founding Equity.
*   **The Frame:** "Incentive Architect." Using the **Basin::Nexus** to vertically integrate their outbound missions.
*   **Prep Doc:** `JOLLY_INTERVIEW_STRATEGY.md`
*   **Demo Doc:** `JOLLY_NEXUS_DEMO.html` (Use this for the call).

## 2. THE STEADY PLAY: BRM LABS (W-2)
*   **Status:** **CONFIRMED.** (Tommy confirmed via text).
*   **When:** **Monday, Feb 2 @ 1:30 PM PT** (Immediately after Jolly).
*   **The Move:** You are meeting "Cuddy" (James, Founder).
*   **The Frame:** "The Mad Scientist." They already love the "March 5,000 Lead" logic.
*   **Conflict Alert:** This is a tight turn. Jolly ends at 1:00 PM. You have 30 mins to switch context from "Incentive Architect" to "Lead Gen Scientist."

## 3. THE CONTRACT PLAY: LISA CARTER
*   **Status:** **FAMILY BOUNDARY SET.** (Told her no weekends).
*   **The Move:** Waiting for her to fix her dead 404 Calendly link.
*   **The Frame:** "Architect vs. Capacity." (Nexus as a Service).

## 4. THE LEVERAGE PLAY: JASSI SINGH (TALSMART)
*   **Status:** PROPOSAL SENT.
*   **Verdict:** **UNVERIFIABLE CLAIMS.** (No record of $55M exit or bike parts distribution). 
*   **Strategy:** **RADIO SILENCE.** We do zero work. If he pays the $4k, we treat it as a secondary cash-cow project. If he stalls, we let it die. He is no longer allowed to extract "mentorship" or "content" from you.
