# 🎓 KUMAR & PROF. LO // EXECUTIVE OUTREACH KIT

## 🎯 STRATEGY
We are leveraging Kumar's academic authority to bridge into a Director-level role. The guest speaking spot with Prof. Lo is the "Trojan Horse"—it establishes you as a Category Leader (Revenue Architect) before you even ask for the job.

## 📧 EMAIL 1: TO PROF. DESMOND LO (cc: Kumar)
**Subject:** Guest Speaker // GTM Architecture & AI-Native Sales Systems (Intro: Kumar Sarangee)

Hi Prof. Lo,

It’s an honor to connect. Kumar has spoken very highly of your work with the GTM MBA class.

As an SCU EMBA '23 alum, I’d be thrilled to guest speak. My current focus is on **'Revenue Architecture'**—specifically how Series A/B startups are moving away from manual SDR motions and toward automated, signal-driven GTM engines.

I can share a practical "Battle Map" with your students on:
1. **The Signal Refinery:** How to mine intent data (RevGenius, LinkedIn, Dark Social) using Python and LLMs.
2. **The New GTM Stack:** Why the future isn't HubSpot/Salesforce management, but API-driven orchestration.
3. **Closing the Chasm:** Moving from founder-led sales to machine-driven scale.

Please let me know if there’s a specific date in the Spring 2026 syllabus that fits.

Best,

Leon Basin
Director of GTM Architecture

## 📧 EMAIL 2: INTERNAL TO KUMAR (The Ask)
**Subject:** Thanks for the intro! + Seeking your advice on Director-level roles

Hi Kumar,

Thank you again for the introduction to Desmond. I’m really excited to give back to the SCU community and share what I’ve been building.

As I mentioned, I’m looking to pivot into a **hands-on Director of GTM Architecture / Revenue Engineering** role. While the fractional consulting is a great proof-of-concept, I’m ready to plant flags and build a long-term engine for a high-growth founder.

**I’ve put together a specialized Director One-Pager here:**
👉 [https://basinleon.github.io/director-gtm-architect.html](https://basinleon.github.io/director-gtm-architect.html)

If anyone in the EMBA alumni network or your personal circle is looking for a "Builder" who can bridge the gap between business strategy and deep technical automation, would you be open to sharing this with them?

Specifically, I’m looking for founders who are:
* Series A/B.
* Struggling with high CAC or manual sales processes.
* Looking for a technical GTM leader, not just a manager.

Would love to grab that coffee soon to catch up properly!

Best, 

Leon

## 🛠️ ACTION ITEMS
1. **Host the One-Pager:** I have already created `director-gtm-architect.html` in your directory.
2. **Sync the CRM:** Use the [NEXUS ULTIMATE CRM](./NEXUS_ULTIMATE_CRM.html) as your visual proof during the "quick chat" with Jared.
3. **LinkedIn Scan:** If you find 5 specific founders in Kumar's network, send those as a short list to him on Tuesday.
