# 🦅 OPERATION: CLAY
**Role:** GTM Engineer (Sales Led)
**Status:** ATTACK PHASE

---

## 1. THE ANGLE (The "Competitor")
You didn't just "use" Clay. You built an internal version of it (`Basin::Nexus`).
*   **Narrative:** "I love the philosophy of programmatic GTM so much that I hand-coded my own Python extraction layer. Now I want to do it for you."
*   **Proof:** The `mad_scientist_pipeline.py` IS a Clay table, but in Python.

## 2. THE COLD DM / EMAIL

### THE "BUILDER" PITCH
**Subject:** I built a mini-Clay in Python (Basin::Nexus)

"Hi [Hiring Manager],

I see you're hiring a GTM Engineer.

I've been obsessed with Programmable GTM for the last 2 years. I actually built my own internal tool, **Basin::Nexus**, which uses Python to scrape, enrich (via DeepSeek), and score leads automatically.

It's essentially a hard-coded version of what Clay does beautifully with UI.

I'm applying because I want to stop building the *tool* and start building the *workflows* for your customers. I have the Ops background (Fudo/Sense) to know *what* to build, and the Engineering chops (Python/SQL) to actually build it.

Best,
Leon Basin
Principal GTM Engineer"

## 3. INTERVIEW PREP (The Pivot)
You are worried about "wasting time." You had 3-4 interviews. **Why didn't they close?**
*   **Diagnosis:** You pitched "Strategy" (Head of) instead of "Execution" (Engineer).
*   **The Pivot:** We use the jobs to *validate* the Engineer persona.
*   **Confidence:** There ARE enough jobs. "GTM Engineer" is the fastest growing title in SaaS because AI is making "Sales Reps" obsolete. You are positioning yourself on the winning side.

## 4. NEXT STEPS
1.  **Apply to Clay.**
2.  **Apply to Apollo.**
3.  **Apply to Cortex.**
*Goal:* Get 1 interview with the NEW persona. If it feels different, we win.
