# 🦅 BASIN x TALSMART: THE "CRO" STRATEGY

## 1. THE TITLE PLAY ("The Trojan Horse")
**Your Idea:** "Can I say CRO for TalSmart on LinkedIn?"
**Jassi's Answer (Timestamp 1:04:00):** *"You can write Chief Revenue Officer, you can even write CEO of TalSmart on LinkedIn, I don't mind."*

**The Strategy:**
*   **Immediate Update:** Update LinkedIn to **"Chief Revenue Officer (Partner) at TalSmart."**
*   **Why this wins:**
    *   **Credibility:** You are no longer "unemployed" or "consulting." You are the CRO of a Sales Training company.
    *   **Network Access:** Jassi explicitly said: *"It also comes with a humongous database of sales leaders... which we can provide exclusively to you, Leon, to kick off your consulting."*
    *   **The Double Dip:** You sell TalSmart ($420 product) to get in the door. Then you upsell YOUR "Basin Systems" consulting to those same Sales Leaders.

## 2. THE MONEY DEAL (Cash Flow)
**Your Goal:** Sustain for 2-3 months while interviewing.
**The Deal:**
*   **Revenue Split:** 50/50 on every unit sold.
*   **Unit Price:** ~$420 (Discounted Training).
*   **Your Cut:** ~$210 per sale.
*   **Volume Needed:** ~24 Sales/mo to hit $5,000.
*   **Ad Budget:** Jassi pays $10,000/mo.
*   **Renegotiation Trigger:** You mentioned "paying him after 250k".
    *   *Correction based on transcript:* Jassi said once **YOU** actially make consistent money ($5k/mo+), *then* the split might drop to 10-20% *residual* so you can use the bulk of the cash to scale operations/hire teams.
    *   *Real Talk:* Don't worry about paying him back. Focus on taking your 50% cut NOW.

## 3. IMMEDIATE EXECUTION (This Weekend)
**Jassi's Blocker:** "Help me what structure you need on the website... How do you want to have that journey for that individual for the self-checkout?"

**Your Deliverables (Monday Morning):**
1.  **The "CRO" Resume:** Edited per his feedback (Builder story, removing "sales rep" noise).
2.  **The Funnel Map:** A visual flow of *Ad -> Landing Page -> Stripe Checkout -> Email Access*.
3.  **The Tech Ask:** "I need access to FirstPromoter and the Stripe account to set up the flow."

## 4. HOW TO "DOUBLE DIP"
1.  **Hunt:** Use the "CRO of TalSmart" title to get meetings with VPs of Sales.
2.  **Hook:** "I want to give your team a free assessment to see if they can pass the 'Mesh Test'."
3.  **Sell 1 (The Chip):** Sell them the TalSmart training for their team. (You make 50%).
4.  **Sell 2 (The Upsell):** "Now that your team is trained, do you want the *System* that found you? I can build your outbound engine." (You make 100% of your consulting fee).
    *   *Jassi approved this:* "You can show it to them immediately... 'I can do the same thing, but quick, quick, quick.'"

**VERDICT:**
This is the "Golden Ticket."
You get the Title. You get the Database. You get the Product.
And you are **still free** to interview for a full-time role elsewhere if you want.
**TAKE THE DEAL.**
