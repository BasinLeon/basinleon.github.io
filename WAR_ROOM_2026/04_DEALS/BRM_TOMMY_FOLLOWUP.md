# Follow-up: Tommy Lee (Scheduling)

**Subject:** Re-confirming next steps / Apologies for the delay

Hi Tommy,

I wanted to quickly follow up and apologize for the radio silence over the last 48 hours. That bug really took me out of commission, but I am finally back at 100% and ready to roll.

I know we were aiming for yesterday or today for the conversation with James. Given the timing, I’d love to look at Monday or Tuesday of next week to ensure we have the right dedicated time to dive into the GTM architecture I discussed with Lane.

Please let me know if there's a fresh Ashby link or if you'd like me to provide some specific slots for early next week.

Excited to keep this moving.

Best,

Leon
