**Subject:** Case Study: Dark Social Signal Extraction (Reddit/X)

Hi Lane,

As promised, here is the case study on how I extract high-intent signals from **Dark Social** (Reddit, X, and private communities).

The core of the strategy is bypassing broad intent providers and building custom "Refineries" that monitor technical conversations in real-time. Whether it's a procurement lead complaining about Coupa on `/r/procurement` or a CFO mentioning a NetSuite renewal on X, we can ingest that signal and priority-route it to the team within minutes.

I look forward to discussing how we can point this engine at the BRM target list.

Best,

Leon
