Subject: Friday 1:30 PM / The Internal Build Proposal

Hi Jassi,

**On the resume:** You are spot on. It looks like a patchwork quilt right now. I am cleaning up the LinkedIn profile today to reflect the reality: I was a "Mercenary Builder" (short missions), but now I am moving in-house to build one sustained engine.

To that end—I’ve drafted the roadmap to bring me in-house as **Head of Revenue Systems**.

**The Methodology:** I’ve audited your "Predictive Prospecting" course. My first deliverable is **automating your "3D Model"** (Strategy/Tech/Revenue Scoring) using my AI agents.

1.  **The Beachhead:** We point that engine at the **Vietnam/Tech** market (<100 employees) immediately.
2.  **The Scale:** We expand to the 25-Country target within 90 days.
3.  **The Asset:** I install **Basin::Nexus** internally on Day 1.

I’ve attached the **Role Proposal** outlining the structure ($180k Base model) and the build schedule.

**Does Friday at 1:30 PM still work for you to review this and get moving?**

I want to help you close this hiring loop this week so we can start building next Monday.

Best,

Leon
