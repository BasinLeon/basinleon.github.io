# PROPOSAL: HEAD OF REVENUE SYSTEMS
**To:** Jassi Singh (TalSmart)
**From:** Leon Basin
**Date:** Jan 30, 2026

---

### **1. THE MISSION**
To build the "Global Outbound Engine" for TalSmart.

*   **The Beachhead:** Capitalize on the "Vietnam Shift" (US Tech <100 employees).
*   **The Expansion:** Scale the same "Signal Refinery" architecture to 25+ countries globally.

---

### **2. THE "JUMPS" (ADDRESSING THE RISK)**

*   **The Concern:** You noted my resume shows short stints. You are right to ask.
*   **The Reality:** I have been a "Mercenary Builder" hired to build zero-to-one GTM systems for Series A startups, then hand them off.
*   **The Shift:** I am finished with the mercenary model. I am looking for a **home**. I want to plant my flag with a team where I can build the engine AND drive the car for the next 5-10 years.

---

### **3. THE ROLE: HEAD OF REVENUE SYSTEMS (INTERNAL)**
I am proposing to come onboard to lead the B2B Outbound function globally.

*   **Automate the "3D Model":** My first deliverable is to digitize your "Predictive Prospecting" framework (Strategy/Tech/Revenue) into an automated scoring agent.
*   **The "Vietnam" Campaign:** Execute the high-intent campaign targeting US firms hiring in Vietnam but lacking US sales leadership.
*   **The Day 1 Asset:** I bring **Basin::Nexus** (my proprietary AI agent system) with me. TalSmart gets a "digital workforce" on Day 1.

---

### **4. THE 90-DAY EXECUTION PLAN**

| Phase | Goal | Key Deliverable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Days 1-30** | **The Pilot (Vietnam)** | Integration with Salesforce. First 1,000 target leads enriched with "3D Scores". |
| **Days 31-60** | **The "Wake Up"** | Launch automated outreach. A/B test "Career Intelligence" messaging. |
| **Days 61-90** | **Global Replication** | Replicate the workflow for the next 5 target countries. Hire/Train 1-2 junior SDRs. |

---

### **5. COMPENSATION STRUCTURE (STABILITY + UPSIDE)**

*   **Base Salary:** **$180,000 / year** ($15,000/mo).
    *   *Justification:* This provides the stability I need to stop "consulting" and focus 100% on TalSmart.
*   **Commission:** **15% Commission** on closed B2B deals.
*   **Equity:** Standard 4-year vesting schedule.

---

### **6. CLOSING**
I'm not looking for another project. I'm looking for the team I win a championship with. Let's build this engine together.
