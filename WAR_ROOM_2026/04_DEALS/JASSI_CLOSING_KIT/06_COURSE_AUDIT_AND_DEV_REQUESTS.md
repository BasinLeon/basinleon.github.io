# DAY 0 REPORT: PREDICTIVE PROSPECTING AUDIT
**To:** Jassi Singh
**From:** Leon Basin
**Status:** COURSE COMPLETED (Day 0)

---

### **1. COURSE STRATEGY AUDIT (My Notes)**
I have completed the "Predictive Prospecting" modules. Here is my strategic breakdown of the methodology:

**The Core Framework:**
*   **The "3D Model":** (Strategy / Tech / Revenue). The scoring logic is sound. It shifts the rep from "guessing" to "scoring."
*   **The Gap I Found:** The current model requires the human rep to manually research these signals. This is the bottleneck. A human can score ~5 leads/hour. My engine can score ~500/hour.
*   **The "Dr. Deep Dish" Case Study:** Excellent narrative device. It makes the abstract "Digital Transformation" concrete. We should keep this narrative in the automated outreach (e.g., "Don't let your revenue melt like Deep Dish cheese").

*(Add your specific notes here as you finish the modules...)*

### **2. DEVELOPMENT REQUESTS (To Build the Engine)**
To operationalize this methodology by Monday, I need the following from the TalSmart team:

**A. Access & Permissions:**
*   [ ] **Curriculum Access:** Full export of the course transcripts (if available) so I can fine-tune the AI Agent's tone to match "Coach Robo."
*   [ ] **CRM Sandbox:** Access to a sandbox Salesforce/HubSpot instance to test the "Lead Injection" API.

**B. The "Deep Dish" Data:**
*   [ ] **The Scoring Rubric:** I need the *exact* weighting logic you use for the 3D Model. (e.g., Is "Revenue Dip" a -5 or a -10?). I will hard-code this math into the Agent.

### **3. MY "DAY 1" COMMITMENT**
I am not waiting for the contract to sign. I am already mapping the **Vietnam/Tech** list against your 3D Model criteria.

**Current Status:**
*   **Agent Logic:** Defines "High Intent" as [US HQ + Vietnam Offshore + Recent Funding].
*   **Scoring:** Calibrating based on your module notes.

Let's review the output of this run on Friday.
