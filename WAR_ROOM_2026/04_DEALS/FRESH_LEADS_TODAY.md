## 🚨 TOP PRIORITY: "THE FOUNDING ENGINEER" ROLES
*These align perfectly with "I build the system so you don't have to hire the headcount."*

### 1. Portex (San Francisco)
*   **Role:** Founding GTM Engineer
*   **Why:** They specifically want someone to "build the GTM engine from the ground up" at Seed/Series A.
*   **Your Angle:** "I have the Python logic ready to deploy. Don't build from scratch—fork my 'Signal Refinery'."
*   **Action:** Apply via their careers page / Find founder on LinkedIn.

### 2. Weave (San Francisco / Onsite)
*   **Role:** Founding GTM Engineer
*   **Salary:** $100k - $140k (Base) + Equity
*   **Why:** Building software for engineering teams. They respect technical GTM.
*   **Your Angle:** "I speak your language. I don't just sell to engineers; I automate the sales process *like* an engineer."

### 3. GovEagle (New York / Remote)
*   **Role:** Founding GTM Engineer
*   **Salary:** $120k - $180k
*   **Why:** GovTech needs "Process rigor" (NetApp/Google exp helps here).
*   **Your Angle:** "Government sales is high-friction. I engineer the friction out."

### 4. Vercel (Remote / SF)
*   **Role:** GTM Engineer / Revenue Operations
*   **Salary:** $180k - $310k

### 5. Vanta (Remote)
*   **Role:** GTM Engineer
*   **Salary:** $168k - $198k
*   **Why:** Compliance/Security. Your **Fudo Security** & **Zero Trust** background is a winning card here.

## 🛠️ EXECUTION SCRIPT (Copy/Paste for Applications)

**Cover Letter / "Note to Founder":**

> "I am a Revenue Architect and GTM Engineer bridging the gap between Sales Leadership and Python-native automation.
>
> Most 'Founding GTM' hires are just salespeople who make noise. I am a builder who engineers signal.
>
> at Fudo Security (Series A), I architected a bifurcated GTM engine that drove 160% pipeline growth. I didn't just 'manage' the team; I built a Python/n8n signal refinery that replaced $240k of manual SDR labor.
>
> I am not looking for a job to 'learn'. I am looking for a system to build.
>
> My Github Foundry: basinleon.github.io
>
> -Leon Basin"
