# 🦅 JASSI PARTNERSHIP: THE DEAL MEMO

## 1. THE PIVOT
**What happened:** You pitched a **Vendor Service** ($5,000/mo retainer for Lead Gen). Jassi rejected "renting" you.
**What did he offer?** He offered a **Strategic Partnership** (50% Profit Share on a funded business).

**The Reality:** 
- He does not value "Lead Gen" as a service because AI is driving the cost to zero (Commodity).
- He **highly values** your ability to "Translate Art to Tech" and "Build Systems" (Asset).
- He is inviting you to be a **Co-Founder/Partner** in his cash-flow business (TalSmart) to fund the future business (CoachRobo).

## 2. THE DEAL STRUCTURE (Phase 1: TalSmart)
**Objective:** Create a self-service automated revenue engine for TalSmart.
**Your Role:** Architect & Builder (Website, Funnel, User Journey).
**His Role:** Financier (Pays for tools, Ads, Recruiters).

| Component | The Terms |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Product** | TalSmart Assessments ($20) & Sales Training ($400 - $800). |
| **Your Comp** | **50% Commission** on revenue generated through your system. |
| **Ad Budget** | **$10,000/mo** (Paid by Jassi). You manage the spend. |
| **Goal** | Generate consistent cash flow (e.g., $10k-$20k/mo). |
| **Transition** | Once TalSmart hits revenue targets, profits fund **CoachRobo**, where you get your $5k-$10k retainer + Equity. |

### The Math (Why this beats $5k/mo)
*   **Old Deal:** Capped at $5,000/mo.
*   **New Deal (50% Split):**
    *   Sell 10 Trainings ($400 ea) = $4,000 Revenue -> **$2,000 You.**
    *   Sell 50 Trainings ($400 ea) = $20,000 Revenue -> **$10,000 You.**
    *   *Note:* He is paying for the ads to drive this. This is **Leverage.**

## 3. THE "WIFE & FAMILY" TALK TRACK
They will ask: *"Did you get the job?"*
**Your Answer:** *"No, I got something better. I got a Business Partner."*

**Key Points to hit:**
1.  **"I am not an employee."** employees get fired. Partners get paid while they sleep.
2.  **"The Risk is Low."** He is putting up the capital ($10,000/mo for ads). I am putting in the architecture.
3.  **"The Upside is Uncapped."** Instead of a $60k salary, I have a clear path to $100k-$200k if I execute this funnel.
4.  **"The Future is Secured."** This opens the door to **Tax-Free Tech Equity** (Section 1202) in the future AI company (CoachRobo), which could be the retirement ticket.

## 4. IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN (The "Test" Month)
He gave you a **1-Month Pilot**. We have to sprint.

**THIS WEEKEND:**
1.  **The Funnel Audit:** Review TalSmart's current site. It's likely friction-heavy.
2.  **The Landing Page:** Build a "High-Converting" Landing Page (Framer/Webflow).
    *   *Hook:* "Why modern sales training fails."
    *   *Offer:* $20 Assessment to diagnose the problem.
    *   *Upsell:* $400 Training to fix it.
3.  **The Tech Stack:** Set up Stripe integration (or check his current cart) + FirstPromoter (tracking).

**MONDAY MORNING:**
*   Email Jassi: "Funnel V1 is ready. Here is the link. Let's turn on the ads."
