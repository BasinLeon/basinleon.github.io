# 🦅 JASSI CLOSING: THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT

**Strategy:** 
This is the final move to turn Jassi Singh from a "Time Waster" into a "Funding Source."
We do not ask for a job. We present a Partnership Agreement.
He pays $4k/month + Tool Costs + Ads.
We build the "Clay + Apollo + OpenAI" System.
We split the upside 50/50.

**Subject:** The Implementation Plan (Clay + Apollo Architecture)

Hi Jassi,

I’ve mapped out the exact architecture to scale the TalSmart lead engine. 

To execute this, I am moving from a "consultant" frame to a "builder" frame. I don't want hourly fees; I want to build the asset with you.

**The Proposal:**
1. **The System:** I will architect and deploy the Clay -> Apollo -> SmartLead stack.
2. **The Investment:** You cover the tool costs (~$200/mo) and the Ad Budget ($10k/mo).
3. **The Deployment Fee:** $4,000 (One-time setup fee to configure the n8n logic and domains).
4. **The Upside:** We split the revenue from the leads generated 50/50.

**Why this works:**
- You get a world-class system without the agency retainer ($15k/mo).
- I get to build the "Perfect Machine" using my proprietary stack.
- We both win when units are sold.

I've attached the architecture diagram below. If you give the green light, I can have the domains warming up by Tuesday.

Best,
Leon
