Hi Volodya,

Thank you for the thoughtful feedback. You are asking the exact right questions—these are the same rigorous questions I asked myself before making this pivot.

Here is the reality of the market right now:

**"You have no formal SW programming experience - correct?"**
Correct. I am not a theoretical Software Engineer; I am a **Revenue Architect**.
The difference is critical. Companies today are drowning in software engineers who can write code but don't understand how a business makes decision or money. 
I have spent 15 years understanding the "money" side (Sales/GTM). Now, I use code (Python/AI) to automate that side. I am not competing with their Core Engineering team; I am building the "glue" that connects their product to their revenue.

**"Are there many companies that need a person with this skill set?"**
This is actually the fastest-growing gap in Silicon Valley.
It's called **"Forward Deployed Engineering"** or **"GTM Engineering."**
Companies like Palantir, Snowflake, and OpenAI are hiring specifically for this blend: people who can talk to a C-Level executive *and* write the script to solve their problem on the spot. A pure engineer cannot sell. A pure salesperson cannot build. The person who does both is a unicorn.

**"Will your claims withstand the scrutiny if dug deeper?"**
Yes. Because I bring the evidence.
I don't just "talk" about the skills in interviews. I show them my **GitHub Portfolio** (83,000+ lines of code) and I walk them through the live applications I built.
In my last 3 interviews (including an onsite with the CEO of Ambient.ai), they didn't ask "can you code?"—they asked "how fast can you deploy this for us?"

I appreciate you challenging me on this. It ensures I stay sharp.
See you both soon.

Love,
Leon
