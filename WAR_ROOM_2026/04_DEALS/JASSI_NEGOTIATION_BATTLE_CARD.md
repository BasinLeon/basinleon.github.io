# JASSI SINGH NEGOTIATION BATTLE CARD
**Objective:** Close Head of Revenue Systems Role @ $180K Base within 7 Days.

---

### **1. THE OPENER (SET THE FRAME)**
"Jassi, I've consolidated my consulting practice because I don't want to build 10 small things. I want to build one massive thing. The Vietnam-to-Global strategy is that thing. I'm ready to come in-house on Monday if we can align on the structure."

---

### **2. HANDLING OBJECTIONS**

#### **Objection: "Can we start with a lower base ($100k) + higher commission?"**
*   **Your Response:** "I appreciate the commission upside, and I want that too. But the reason I'm moving in-house is **stability**. At $180k, my family is secure, and I can shut down all other consulting discussions (SolveJet, etc) to focus 100% on TalSmart. If we go lower on base, I have to keep my side hustles alive, which splits my focus. I want to give you 100%."

#### **Objection: "Why do you need to be internal? Why not just a contractor?"**
*   **Your Response:** "Because you want a Global Engine (25 countries). A contractor builds a feature and leaves. An **Internal Head of Systems** owns the roadmap, hires the team, and fixes it when it breaks at 2 AM. You want an owner, not a renter."

#### **Objection: "What if it doesn't work?" (Risk)**
*   **Your Response:** "Let's put a **30-Day Out Clause** in the contract. If I haven't deployed the Signal Refinery and shown you the first batch of Vietnam leads in 30 days, we rip it up. I'm betting on myself."

### **3. THE IP NEGOTIATION (Basin::Nexus)**
*   **Jassi:** "Who owns the code?"
*   **You:** "I retain the ownership of the underlying engine (Basin::Nexus). TalSmart gets a **Perpetual, Royalty-Free License** to use it internally forever. It's like you hiring a photographer—you own the photos (the leads/process), I own the camera (the code). This way you get the tech on Day 1 without paying $500k to build it."

---

### **4. THE CLOSE**
"Jassi, solveJet is asking for a contract renewal on Monday. I want to tell them 'No' because I'm joining TalSmart. Can we shake on this structure today so I can send that email?"
