**Objective:** 30-Day Signal-to-Lead Generation Pilot
**Owner:** Leon Basin (Revenue Architect)

## 1. THE SYSTEM: "BASIN::NEXUS" (How it works)
Jassi, you asked for clarification. Most lead gen is "Volume-based" (Spray and Pray). My system is **"Signal-based."**

1.  **Scanning (The Noise):** My agents scan 50+ data sources (Company News, Financial Reports, Tech Stack Changes, Hiring Data).
2.  **Scoring (The Filter):** I automate your **3D Model**. Every lead is scored 1-10 on Strategy change, Revenue change, and Tech change. 
3.  **Refining (The Signal):** We only dial/email leads with a **Score > 40.** 
4.  **Execution (The Close):** High-intent leads are routed to your team (or my agents) with a full "Intelligence Dossier" so the call is warm.

## 2. THE PILOT: 30-DAY U.S. SPRINT
We start with the USA market to prove the architecture.

*   **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Ingest ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) and establish 3D Scoring axes.
*   **Phase 2 (Week 2):** Deploy "Refinery Agents" to harvest signals in the U.S. IT sector.
*   **Phase 3 (Week 3-4):** Delivery of **Qualified Meetings / Validated Whales.**

## 3. THE ECONOMICS (Month-to-Month)
To maintain **Stability and Velocity**, we operate as follows:

*   **Monthly Retainer:** **$5,000 USD**
    *   *Includes:* System setup, 3D Model automation, data compute costs, and 20 hours of hands-on "Architecture Tuning" (Lead Quality Optimization).
*   **Duration:** Month-to-Month (Cancel anytime with 7 days notice).
*   **The Outcome:** A predictable pipeline of sales-ready tech companies with verified "Strike Zone" scores (>40).

## 4. THE GOAL
We prove the system in 30 days. When we hit the result targets, we discuss the permanent "Head of Revenue Systems" role and the shift to the $180k/yr in-house structure.

**Jassi, I've already audited the course. The machine is built. We just need to point it at the U.S. market.**
