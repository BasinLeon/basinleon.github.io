# 🦅 OPERATION: APOLLO.IO
**Role:** Revenue Operations, GTM Engineer (Remote)
**Status:** ATTACK PHASE

---

## 1. THE RECON (Apollo's Pain)
Apollo is massive. Their pain point isn't "more leads." It's **Data Fidelity** and **Orchestration**.
*   Users (like us) abuse the system.
*   Data gets messy.
*   They need an Engineer who understands the *user* side of the API to build better internal rails.

---

## 2. THE ASSETS
*   **Resume:** Principal GTM Engineer (Updated)
*   **Portfolio:** `Basin::Nexus` (Proof we script their tool)
*   **Narrative:** "I don't just use Apollo. I build the machines that run on top of it."

## 3. THE COLD DM / EMAIL (Drafts)

### OPTION A: The "Power User" (Technical)
**Subject:** `api.apollo.io` -> Rate limits & Lead Fidelity

"Hi [Hiring Manager],

I've been building custom GTM pipelines on top of the Apollo API for 2 years (managing 80k+ leads via Python scripts).

I noticed you're looking for a GTM Engineer. Most candidates are Salesforce admins or Marketers. **I am a Builder.**

I wrote my own signal listener (`Basin::Nexus`) that intercepts intent signals and auto-enriches them via Apollo before they ever hit the CRM. I want to bring that same 'Engineering-First' mindset to your internal RevOps.

Here is the repo of what I built: [basinleon.github.io](https://basinleon.github.io)

Best,
Leon Basin
Principal GTM Engineer"

### OPTION B: The "Debugger" (Problem Solver)
**Subject:** Debugging the GTM funnel (High Noise / Low Conversion)

"Hi [Hiring Manager],

Most RevOps teams view a 'leaky funnel' as a sales training problem. I view it as a **filtering bug**.

I'm a GTM Engineer who uses Python (not just CSVs) to pre-process lead data from Apollo to ensure 99% fidelity before a human rep ever sees it.

I see you're hiring for RevOps Engineering. I don't want to manage the status quo; I want to patch the leaks in your own GTM motion using the same scripts I used to drive $11M in pipeline at Sense.

Open to a 10-min code walkthrough?

Best,
Leon Basin"
