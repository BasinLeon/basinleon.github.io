# THE JASSI PITCH PROTOCOL
## Date: January 30, 2026 | 1:00 PM CST (11:00 AM PST)
## Strategy: "THE MESH" (Project-Based, High Leverage)

---

## THE FRAME
**You are not auditioning for a job. You are scoping a technical project.**
**You are a Full-Time Candidate in final rounds elsewhere. This is a PROJECT to you.**

---

## PART 1: OPEN WITH LEVERAGE (First 2 Minutes)

**Say This:**
> "Jassi, full transparency before we start. I am currently in 3rd round interviews for full-time Head of GTM roles. Since you are offering project-based work—not full-time employment—I will continue my interview processes.
>
> That said, I am intrigued by what you are building. I am committed to completing this project for you if we proceed. But we need to structure it realistically."

**Why:** This removes desperation. You are valuable. He's lucky to have you.

---

## PART 2: SELL LEON (5 Minutes)

**The Story Arc:**
1. "I've been in sales for 15 years. Human-to-human, voice-to-voice. I know the process."
2. "I evolved into GTM Strategy—building the systems, not just running the plays."
3. "Two years ago, I taught myself to automate it. Python. APIs. AI Agents."
4. "At my last company (Fudo), I built the GTM engine from scratch. 160% pipeline growth. $260k saved by replacing 10 SDRs with 2."

**Why:** He needs to trust YOU before he trusts the system.

---

## PART 3: JASSI'S CORRECTION (Use His Language)

**Acknowledge his feedback:**
> "Jassi, I heard your feedback. Let me be clear on the distinction:
> - **Lead Generation** = Finding the list using Triggers (job changes, hiring signals). I use Clay for this.
> - **Prospecting (Your 3D Model)** = Qualifying the list (Strategy/Revenue/Tech scoring).
>
> Today, I will show you both."

**Why:** He corrected you. Show him you listened.

---

## PART 4: THE DEMO (10-15 Minutes)

**Walk him through the Clay Table (Screen Share):**

1. **"Lead Gen (The Triggers):"**
   > "I pulled 50 VPs of Sales from the USA who changed jobs in the last 90 days at Tech companies under 500 employees. This is the Lead Generation step."

2. **"Enrichment:"**
   > "I enriched them using LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, and Apollo. Title, company size, tech stack."

3. **"Prospecting (The 3D Model):"**
   > "Now I apply YOUR framework—Strategy, Revenue, Tech—to score them. This one is an 85. This one is a 40. We focus on the 85."

4. **"The Outreach:"**
   > "Here's the message: 'Congrats on the new role. One of the first challenges is understanding your team's gaps. Here's a free assessment...'"

5. **"The Speed:"**
   > "Traditional way: 48-hour void. A human sees the lead two days later.  
   > My way: 5-minute action. The lead is scored, enriched, and routed before they close the browser tab."

**Why:** This is the "proof it works." Simple. Visual. Real.

## PART 5: THE 3 PHASES (5 Minutes)

**Frame it as a Project, not a promise:**

| Phase | Name | Duration | Focus |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| **1** | **SETUP & MESH** | 30 Days (~80 hrs) | Audit tools. Map the 3D Model. Check if systems mesh. |
| **2** | **INTEGRATION** | Months 2-3 | Build APIs. Connect Signal → CRM → Agent. |
| **3** | **EXECUTION** | Month 4+ | Live fire. Leads flow. Meetings booked. |

**Say This:**
> "Jassi, I treat this like construction. We don't pour concrete until we check the soil.
>
> Phase 1 is the Mesh Test. I need to meet your Marketing and Engineering teams. I need to see if my engine fits your vehicle. If it doesn't mesh after 30 days, we shake hands and we're done. No hard feelings.
>
> If it meshes, we move to Phase 2: Integration. That's the wiring—APIs, data flows.
>
> Phase 3 is Execution. That's when the leads flow. That's Month 4."

**Why:** This protects you from "Where are my leads?" in Week 2.

---

## PART 6: THE ASK (2 Minutes)

**Say This:**
> "Jassi, here's the deal:
> - $5,000/month retainer. Month-to-month.
> - Phase 1 is a logic test. Does it mesh?
> - I need access to your Marketing and Engineering teams.
> - If Phase 1 works, we continue. If not, we part as friends.
>
> Does this structure work for you?"
