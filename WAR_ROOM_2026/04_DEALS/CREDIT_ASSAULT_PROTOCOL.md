---

## 🎯 THE SEARCH PARAMETERS (Apollo / Clay Filters)

### 1. The Persona Triple-Threat
*   **Segment A (The Decision Makers):** Founder, CEO, Co-Founder.
*   **Segment B (The Architects):** VP Go-To-Market, VP Sales, VP Revenue, Head of Growth.
*   **Segment C (The Infrastructure):** Head of RevOps, Director of Sales Operations, GTM Lead.

### 2. The Ideal Company Profile (ICP)
*   **Funding Stage:** Series A, Series B (This is your "Sweet Spot" for scaling infrastructure).
*   **Industry:** B2B SaaS, Cybersecurity, Enterprise Software, Cloud Infrastructure, Fintech.
*   **Headcount:** 50 - 250 (They have enough revenue to matter, but their systems are likely still manual).

### 3. The "Signal" Triggers (Filter by these in Clay)
*   **Hiring Signals:** Currently hiring for SDRs, BDRs, or Sales Managers (This indicates a manual labor problem you can automate).
*   **Tech Stack:** Companies using Salesforce + Outreach/Salesloft (They have expensive tools but likely inefficient workflows).
*   **Recent Funding:** Companies that raised in the last 6 months (They have the budget to deploy "Architectural Fees").

## 📈 THE "NEXUS" PITCH STRATEGY
Don't just say "I'm looking for a job." Use the **Architect's Approach**:

**The Hook:**
"I noticed you're hiring for 3 new SDR seats. Instead of adding more manual headcount and overhead, I've built an automated 'Signal Refinery' that does the work of 2 SDRs for the cost of a single API license. I'm an SCU EMBA '23 alum and I want to show you the logic behind it."

## 🛠️ EXECUTION STEPS
1.  **Bulk Export:** Run the search tonight. Do NOT worry about cleaning yet—focus on volume (The "Gather" phase).
2.  **Credit Burn:** If you have 2,000+ credits, run the enrichment on *every* founder to find their LinkedIn, Email, and Company HQ.
3.  **Refine Tomorrow:** Use the `nexus_crm_master.py` to ingest this new bulk list into your `NEXUS_COMMUNITY_CRM.json`.
