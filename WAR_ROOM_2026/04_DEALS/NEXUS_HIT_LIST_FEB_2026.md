# 🦅 BASIN::NEXUS // HIGH-SIGNAL TARGET LIST (FEB 2026)
**Objective:** Identify Series A/B Founders hiring for "Activity" (SDRs/RevOps) and pitch them "Architecture" (Signal Refineries).
**Target Profile:** Recently Funded (2025/2026) + Active "Head of RevOps/Founding SDR" Job Post + High-Velocity Data Environment.

---

## 🎯 TARGET 1: ROX (AI-Native GTM)
*   **Funding:** Backed by Sequoia/General Catalyst (Deep Pockets).
*   **The Signal (Job Post):** Hiring "Founding RevOps Strategy & Innovation Leader."
*   **The Gap (Human Latency):** They are explicitly looking for "AI-native GTM strategy." A traditional RevOps hire will just buy Salesforce plugins. They need an Architect.
*   **The Nexus Pitch:** "You don't need a RevOps Director to manage HubSpot. You need a GTM Engineer to build self-driving pipeline. I just built a refining engine that processes signal in <400ms."

## 🎯 TARGET 2: OCULAR AI (Enterprise Search)
*   **Funding:** Y Combinator (YC) Funded.
*   **The Signal (Job Post):** Hiring "Founding SDR."
*   **The Gap (Human Latency):** They are an AI company hiring a human to do manual dialing? That is a misalignment. They need an *Agentic* SDR framework.
*   **The Nexus Pitch:** "Hiring a Founding SDR is a 2020 playbook. I can deploy a Python-based 'Signal Agent' that does the research of 5 SDRs for the cost of 0. Your product is AI; your GTM should be too."

## 🎯 TARGET 3: RUNWAY FINANCIAL (Fintech)
*   **Funding:** Series B (High Growth).
*   **The Signal (Job Post):** Hiring "Founding Head of Revenue Operations."
*   **The Gap (Human Latency):** Fintech deals are lost on speed. They have massive data throughput. A human RevOps leader will drown in spreadsheets.
*   **The Nexus Pitch:** "Financial data moves fast; your pipeline should match it. I build 'Signal Refineries' that automate the 80% of manual RevOps toil so your team focuses on closing."

## 🎯 TARGET 4: RECO AI (Security/AI)
*   **Funding:** Series A ($30M+).
*   **The Signal (Job Post):** Hiring "Head of RevOps (Operationalizing AI)."
*   **The Gap (Human Latency):** They literally put "Operationalizing AI" in the title. They are begging for you.
*   **The Nexus Pitch:** "Your job post asks for 'Operationalizing AI.' Most candidates will show you ChatGPT prompts. I will show you a Python-based ingestion engine that routes leads via API in real-time."

## 🎯 TARGET 5: REFLECT ORBITAL (Deep Tech/Space)
*   **Funding:** Series A (Hardware/Space).
*   **The Signal (Job Post):** Scaling GTM for 2026 Launch.
*   **The Gap (Human Latency):** Deep Tech founders hate traditional sales "fluff." They respect engineering.
*   **The Nexus Pitch:** "You are launching spacecraft. You shouldn't be launching 'generic email sequences.' My GTM approach is engineered like a system: Logic gates, reliability, zero waste."
