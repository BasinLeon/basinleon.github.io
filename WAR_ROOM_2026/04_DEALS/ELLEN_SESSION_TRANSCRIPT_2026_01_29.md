## KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### 1. THE 30-DAY MESH TEST
> "Maybe 30 days is evaluating whether you can mesh it."
> "The first month is setup. And if it doesn't mesh, you'll tell him it doesn't work. And I'm out."

### 2. THE 3 PHASES (Simple Naming)
- **Phase 1: SETUP** (30 days) - "Will it mesh or won't it?"
- **Phase 2: INTEGRATION** (APIs, tools)
- **Phase 3: EXECUTION** (Month 4+)

### 3. THE LEVERAGE PLAY
> "I'm interviewing for a full time role. That's what I want. And I'm in third interviews."
> "I'm looking at this right now, because you're not offering me a full time job. As a contract, a project based work."
> "While this project is going on, I'm going to still be interviewing."
> "I'll complete the project... but I'm honestly looking for a full time job."

### 4. SELL LEON, NOT JUST THE SYSTEM
> "They want to see my system, but I have to sell yourself."
> "You've been in the market for a long time. Where I did the old fashioned voice to voice."

### 5. DUMMY IT DOWN
> "Make it really simple. People that are really smart can do it simple."
> The 48-hour void vs. 5-minute system comparison.

### 6. PHASE 3 = MONTH 4
> "Phase three, the execution should come about somewhere in the fourth month."
