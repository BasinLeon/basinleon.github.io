**Heading:** The Era of the "Revenue Engineer"
**Subtext:** Why hiring a salesperson is the wrong move for TalSmart.

- Right side: "Revenue Engineer" -> Builds systems, automates outreach, 24/7 intelligence. (Exponential Growth)

**Talk Track:**
"Jassi, you don't need another rep making 50 calls a day. You need a system that makes 500 decisions a minute. That's the difference between Sales and Revenue Engineering."
