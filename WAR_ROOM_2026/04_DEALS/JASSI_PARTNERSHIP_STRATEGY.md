Hi Jassi,

Received — thank you.

I'm enrolling in the course tonight and will complete the assessment by tomorrow. I want to understand the product depth before I finalize the Partnership Proposal.

**By Friday morning**, I'll send you a clean 1-pager outlining:
- The Architecture (Signal Refinery)
- The Economics (Retainer + Commission structure)
- The Timeline (30-Day Sprint to first leads)

If you have 15 minutes Friday afternoon to walk through it together, let's lock that in.

Talk soon,  
**Leon**

## 📄 Partnership Proposal Document (Build Thursday)

**Format:** 1-Page PDF. Clean. Professional.

### Section 1: The Problem
> **The Assessment Void**  
> High-value leads (VPs, Directors) take your assessment and receive a score — but they're treated the same as junior SDRs. The signal decays 90% within 48 hours.

### Section 2: The Solution
> **The Signal Refinery Architecture**  
> [Include: signal_refinery_diagram.svg]  
> - **Sensor:** Webhook catches assessment completion  
> - **Refinery:** LLM + LinkedIn enrichment in <200ms  
> - **Router:** Auto-route Whales to Jassi, SDRs to nurture

### Section 3: The Scope
> **Two Companies. One Engine.**  
> - **TalSmart:** B2B outbound to <500 employee tech companies  
> - **CoachRobo:** Enterprise outbound to 500+ employee tech companies  
> - **Markets:** US (Phase 1) → Vietnam, Global (Phase 2)

### Section 4: The Investment
> | Item | Amount |
> |------|--------|
> | Setup Fee | $10,000 (one-time) |
> | Monthly Retainer | $10,000/month |
> | Commission | 20% of generated revenue |
> 
> **Total Year 1:** $130,000 - $170,000+  
> **Comparison:** Full-time VP of Growth = $250,000+ / year

### Section 5: Next Steps
> 1. **Sign Agreement** → Week of Feb 3  
> 2. **30-Day Sprint** → Build Engine, Configure Clay, Launch Campaign  
> 3. **First Leads** → By March 1, 2026

## 🛡️ Key Talking Points (For Friday Call)

**Why $10k/month?**
> "At $10k/month, you're not renting hours. You're buying **exclusivity**. I'm not juggling 5 other SaaS clients. I'm all in on TalSmart and CoachRobo. That's why the retainer is what it is — it's the cost of **focus**."

**Why this is a bargain:**
> "A full-time VP of Growth costs $250k+/year. I'm giving you the same output for less than half, and you get both companies covered."

**Jassi's own words (use as leverage):**
> - *"I don't want to save the money for your setup or money for your working for the hours. I'm going to pay you that as well."*
> - *"I want to pay you much more so that you don't have to work ever in your life."*
> - *"I'm looking for partners who grow with us."*
