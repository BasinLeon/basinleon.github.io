# PROPOSAL: HEAD OF OUTBOUND & REVENUE SYSTEMS
**To:** Jassi Singh (TalSmart)
**From:** Leon Basin
**Date:** Jan 30, 2026

---

### **THE MISSION**
To build the "Outbound Engine" for TalSmart that targets tech companies (<100 employees) moving to Vietnam, and scales the B2B revenue leg of the business.

---

### **YOUR CONCERN (THE "JUMPS")**
Jassi, you mentioned my resume looks "confusing" with short stints. You are right to ask about that.
**The Reality:** I have been operating as a "Mercenary Builder" – companies hire me to come in, build the zero-to-one GTM system, and then I hand it off.
**The Shift:** I am done with that. I am looking for a **home**. I want to plant my flag with a team where I can build the engine AND drive the car for the next 5-10 years. TalSmart is that home.

---

### **THE ROLE: HEAD OF REVENUE SYSTEMS**
I am proposing to come onboard to lead the B2B Outbound function.

**My Responsibilities:**
1.  **Build the "Signal Refinery":** Deploy the Clay + AI Agents + LinkedIn architecture we discussed.
2.  **Target the "Vietnam Shift":** Execute the campaign targeting US tech firms moving ops to Vietnam.
3.  **Monetize CoachRobo:** Build the outbound motion for the enterprise license ($500/seat).

**The Day 1 Asset:**
I bring **Basin::Nexus** (my proprietary AI agent system) with me. TalSmart gets essentially a "digital workforce" on Day 1 to amplify my output.

---

### **THE 90-DAY PLAN**

| Phase | Goal | Key Deliverable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Days 1-30** | **The Infrastructure** | Integration with Salesforce. Clay tables built. First 1,000 target leads enriched (Vietnam focus). |
| **Days 31-60** | **The "Wake Up"** | Launch automated outreach. A/B test "Career Intelligence" messaging. |
| **Days 61-90** | **The Scale** | First 10 closed-won B2B deals. Hire/Train 1-2 junior SDRs to manage the flow. |

### **COMPENSATION STRUCTURE (STABILITY + UPSIDE)**

I need stability to focus 100% on TalSmart, and upside to align with your growth.

**Proposed Package:**
*   **Base Salary:** **$180,000 / year** ($15,000/mo).
    *   *Why:* This provides the stability I need for my family so I can stop "consulting" and focus entirely on building your revenue.
*   **Variable/Commission:** **Standard Sales Commission** on closed deals (e.g., 10-20%).
*   **Equity:** Standard vesting schedule (4 years).

**Why this deal works for you:**
You get a **Director-level Operator** + a **Proprietary AI System** for the cost of a mid-level Account Executive.

### **CLOSING**
I'm not looking for another "project." I'm looking for the team I win a championship with. Let's build this engine together.
