# 🦅 OPERATION: ASSEMBLY AI (The Bridge)
**Role:** Senior Technical Account Manager (TAM)
**Status:** ATTACK PHASE

---

## 1. THE LOGIC (Why this is safe AND high-growth)
*   **The Bridge:** It uses your Sales/CS legacy (SurveyMonkey/Sanho) so you aren't "faking it."
*   **The Upgrade:** It uses your Python/AI skills (`Basin::Nexus`) to command a higher salary and respect.
*   **The Product:** Voice AI API. You need to know APIs. You know APIs.

---

## 2. THE PLAN (Step-by-Step)

### STEP 1: RESUME ADJUSTMENT (Quick Tweak)
*   Your "GTM Engineer" resume works, BUT for this, we want to highlight "Account Management" slightly more.
*   **Action:** I will create a version called `Leon_Basin_TAM_Resume.html` on your desktop.
    *   *Headline:* **Principal Technical Account Manager (TAM)**
    *   *Summary Key:* "Bridging the gap between Enterprise Clients and API Engineering."

### STEP 2: THE COVER LETTER / EMAIL
*   **Subject:** TAM with Python skills (Managed $300M ARR @ SurveyMonkey)
*   **Body:**
    *   "I've managed Enterprise books ($300M ARR). I know how to handle retention and upsells."
    *   "BUT, I also write code. I can debug a client's API integration in Python so your Engineering team doesn't have to."
    *   "Proof: I built [Basin::Nexus] to automate my own workflow."

### STEP 3: EXECUTION
1.  **I create the TAM Resume.**
2.  **You apply via the YC link** (or AssemblyAI site).
3.  **You feel good** because this role is 100% within your strike zone. No "imposter syndrome" needed.

## 3. APPROVAL
Shall I generate the `Leon_Basin_TAM_Resume.html` now?
