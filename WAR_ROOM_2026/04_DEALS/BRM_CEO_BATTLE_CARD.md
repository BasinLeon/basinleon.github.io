## 1. THE OPENER (THE "MAD SCIENTIST" HOOK)
> "James, Lane told me you have 5,000 leads hitting in March from the 'Metrics' sponsorship. Most teams will burn those leads by manually calling them. I built a system this morning that scans them, detects if they use **Coupa** or **Netsuite**, and auto-drafts the email before a human ever touches it."

## 2. THE DEMO (MAD_SCIENTIST_OUTPUT.json)
*   **Action:** Screen share `view_mad_scientist_report.html`.
*   **Voiceover:** "This is live logic. I fed it 5 domains. It identified that **ClickUp** uses Segment and Angular, so it crafted a pitch about 'data latency'. It saw **TalSmart** uses Salesforce, so it pitched 'integration'. This runs for pennies."

## 3. THE "WATERING HOLE" STRATEGY
> "I also know you have Finance Dinners coming up. My system pre-scrapes the guest list. I can tell you which VP of Finance is attending and what ERP they just installed. You walk into that dinner knowing the answers."

## 4. THE ASK
> "I’m not looking for a marketing manager role. I want to be the **GTM Engineer** who installs this machine. I can have the V1 running before the March leads arrive."

## 5. RECRUITING INTEL (LANE'S FEEDBACK)
*   **Lane:** "Glad you are feeling better! Looking forward to you connecting with James."
*   **The Vibe:** Lane is your champion. He has already sold you to James.
*   **The Trap:** James might be "cost-conscious" (Seed round).
*   **The Counter:** "This system replaces 2 SDRs. It pays for itself in Month 1."
