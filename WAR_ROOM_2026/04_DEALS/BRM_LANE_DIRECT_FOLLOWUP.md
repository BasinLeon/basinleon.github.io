**Subject:** Back at 100% / Coordination for James

Hi Lane,

I’m finally coming up for air after being sidelined by a bug earlier this week. I wanted to send a quick note to let you know I’m fully back in "Mad Scientist" mode and looking forward to our next steps.

I've been refining the logic for that **March Lead Flow** we discussed. There is massive leverage in those 5,000 sponsorship leads if we hit them with the right enrichment layer (specifically targeting the Brex/Coupa/Tier-1 signals) before the team ever touches them. I'm ready to show you and James what a "Signal Refinery" looks like in production.

I'm coordinating with Tommy now to get the Founder conversation on the books for Monday or Tuesday.

Have a great weekend!

Best,

Leon
