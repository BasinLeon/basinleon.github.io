# 🎯 BASIN::NEXUS SNIPER SCRIPTS | FEB 5, 2026

**Objective:** High-status outreach for $150k+ GTM Engineering & Revenue Architecture roles.

---

## 🏗️ THE "PEER ARCHITECT" PLAY (Tier 1 Targets)

### 1. CLAY.COM (GTM Engineer - Enterprise)

**Target:** Head of GTM Ops / Growth Engineering
**Script:**
> "I’ve been following Clay’s expansion into the Enterprise layer. Most teams at your scale are just stacking more SDRs to solve the volume problem.
>
> I’m a GTM Engineer (ex-Google, NetApp) who builds 'Agentic Signal Refineries'—I recently automated 160% pipeline growth at Fudo by replacing manual research with Python-native scrapers. I’m interested in the GTM Engineer role to help architect Clay’s internal revenue engine."

### 2. APOLLO.IO (GTM Engineer)

**Target:** VP of Growth / Head of RevOps
**Script:**
> "Apollo has the best data lake in the world, but most customers only use 10% of the signal. I’m a Revenue Architect specialized in removing 'Human Latency' from the GTM stack.
>
> I build Python-native listeners that catch buyer intent signals before they hit the CRM. I want to bring that degree of precision to the Apollo GTM motion as your GTM Engineer."

### 3. VALARIAN (Max Buchan) - [WARM PATH]

**Target:** Max Buchan (CEO)
**Verified Email:** `max@worldr.com`
**Angle:** "Data Sovereignty / System > Hires"
**Script:**
> "Max, following up on Valarian’s data sovereignty mission. I’ve been analyzing the 'Sovereign GTM' shift and it’s clear your engine needs an architectural layer that handles high-trust signals without human latency.
>
> I’m a Revenue Architect specialized in building 'Signal Refineries' that respect high-trust architecture. I'm ready to deploy the 'System > Hires' framework to automate your current growth bottlenecks so you never have to over-hire SDRs. Ready to show you the blueprint for the 'Invisible Ledger' I built that replaced $424k in manual labor."

## ⚡ THE "90-DAY ARCHITECTURE" PLAY (Founding Roles)

### 4. OCULAR AI (Founding SDR / Growth)

**Target:** Founder
**Script:**
> "You're hiring for a 'Founding SDR' for an AI Search product. Frankly, hiring a human to do manual prospecting for an AI company is a mismatch.
>
> I'm a GTM Engineer. I want to deploy my 'Nexus' engine to Ocular as a 90-day Architecture Sprint. I'll build the autonomous pipeline so you never have to hire a 3rd or 4th SDR."

### 5. ROX (Head of RevOps / Founding)

**Target:** LinkedIn Post / Founder (Sequoia Backed)
**Script:**
> "I noticed ROX is scaling for the Enterprise pivot. That move usually breaks the legacy GTM stack.
>
> I’m a Revenue Architect specialized in the PLG-to-Enterprise transition. I build the technical pipes (Python/Clay/n8n) to handle high-intent signals without bloating the headcount. Ready to show you the blueprint."

### 6. PORTEX (Founding GTM Engineer)

**Target:** Mike Smith (CEO)
**Script:**
> "Mike, I build GTM engines for logistics. I noticed you're scaling Portex—I have the Python logic to automate your freight prospecting so you don't have to hire 5 SDRs. I’m a GTM Engineer (ex-Google, NetApp) specialized in removing friction from high-velocity logistics stacks. Proposing a 90-day sprint to instrument your signal."

### 7. WEAVE (Founding GTM Engineer)

**Target:** David McNeil (Head of Growth / Founder)
**Script:**
> "David, noticing the shift in Weave's GTM as you move towards multi-product expansion. I'm a Revenue Architect specialized in removing 'Human Latency' from high-velocity stacks. I don't hire SDRs—I build pipelines. Proposing a 90-day sprint to instrument your signal and automate the research phase entirey."

### 8. GOVEAGLE (Founding GTM Engineer)

**Target:** Akash M. / Gabe Villasana
**Script:**
> "Government sales is high-friction, but GovEagle is changing the capture game. I’m a GTM Engineer specialized in engineering that friction out. I build Python-native signal refineries that replace manual capture work with automated intent detection. I want to build the government-grade revenue engine for GovEagle."

## 🦅 THE "WARM PATH" REACTIVATION

### 9. ANTHONY WALSH (OKTA)

**Target:** Anthony Walsh (LinkedIn)
**Script:**
> "Anthony, circling back on the Okta GTM intro. I’m currently deep in the loop with Vanta and Reveal Security on their Architecture arcs.
>
> Since you’ve seen the Okta machine from the inside, I’d love your 2-minute perspective on who the best person is to discuss 'Agentic GTM' with there. Happy to swap notes on the 'Signal Refinery' I've been building."

### 10. MINH PHAM (NVIDIA)

**Target:** Minh Pham
**Script:**
> "Minh, the 'Agentic AI' role at NVIDIA is a 1:1 match for the Basin::Nexus architecture I’ve finalized.
>
> I've attached my technical brief on replacing SDR headcount with autonomous agents. Who is the hiring lead I should get this in front of to save them the noise of the standard applicant pool?"
