# ⚔️ BATTLE CARD: JOLLY (Trevor)
**Date:** Jan 31, 2026 @ 12:00 PM
**Objective:** Pivot from "Candidate" to "Revenue Architect / GTM Engineer."
**Core Value Prop:** Building the "Whale Listener" (Automated Signal Detection) for Jolly.

---

## 1. THE OPENER (Set the Frame)
**Do not** ask about the "Sales culture."
**Do** ask about the "Signal Infrastructure."

> "Trevor, I've been digging into the Jolly platform. I see the vision: You are the 'Signal Refinery' for creative talent. But right now, it feels like the signal is **passive**. Candidates have to *come* to the opportunities. I want to talk about how we make it **active**."

---

## 2. THE DEMO (The "Engine Room")
*Context: You are sharing your screen and showing **VS Code** directly. No shiny UI. Just raw power.*

> "I don't use a dashboard. I use **VS Code** as my command center.
> 
> [Show `mad_scientist_pipeline.py`]
>
> This is **Basin::Nexus**. It's a Python rig I wrote that:
> 1.  **Monitors** high-signal benchmarks (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Coinbase).
> 2.  **Scrapes** their career pages every 60 seconds.
> 3.  **Routes** the data through a local LLM (DeepSeek R1) to analyze fit.
> 4.  **Alerts** me instantly if it's a match.
>
> **The Result:** I don't browse job boards. My system hunts for me while I sleep."

---

## 3. THE PITCH (The Feature)
> "Imagine if **Jolly** wasn't just a discovery platform, but a **Radar Defense System** for talent.
>
> What if a freelancer could say: *'Alert me the second a FinTech startup in NYC posts a Product Design role'*?
>
> You have the data. I have the architecture to build the notification layer.
>
> **I’m not looking to be valid 'Sales Rep' number 50. I want to come in as a GTM Engineer and build these signal loops to drive retention and engagement for your users.**"

## 4. TECHNICAL & STRATEGIC DEPTH (If he probes)

### The "How" (Python/Technical)
*   "It's a Python array monitoring `requests` to specific endpoints."
*   "I use `BeautifulSoup` or `Selenium` for the scrape, parse the JSON payload for keywords."
*   "Then I employ a simple webhook (via `n8n` or direct API) to trigger the notification."
*   "For Jolly, we’d scale this using your internal Event Bus to trigger user notifications based on saved search criteria."

### The "Why" (Business Impact)
*   **Retention:** Users stay logged in (or keep the app installed) because the *value* is real-time.
*   **Premium Tier:** "This is a feature users would pay $20/month for. 'Be the first to know.'"

---

## 5. THE CLOSE
> "I can sell this vision to clients because I **build** it. Does Jolly have a role for someone who sits right at that intersection of Technical Build and Revenue Strategy?"
## 6. THE RESUME WALKTHROUGH (The "Builder" Frame)
*If he asks: "Walk me through your background."*
*Do NOT recite the resume. Recite the BUILDS.*

*   **FUDO SECURITY (2024):** "I was hired for Ops, but I ended up **building** the automation layer. I wrote the Python scripts that replaced 3 people's manual data entry."
*   **SENSE (2021):** "I didn't just manage BDRs. I **architected** the outreach sequences and API triggers that doubled their output."
*   **SURVEYMONKEY (2019):** "I managed $300M in business, but my real value was **engineering** the technical requirements between Sales and Product."
*   **SANHO (2015):** "I built the logistics fulfillment system from scratch."

**The Theme:** "Everywhere I go, I don't just do the job. I **engineer** the system that does the job better."
