Subject: Re: Partnership Discussion - Friday 1:30 PM

Hi Jassi,

Looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 1:30 PM.

I've been thinking about our last discussion regarding the "gap" in traditional sales teams—specifically the lag between strategy and execution.

Over the weekend, I prototyped a solution. I built a multi-agent AI system ("Basin::Nexus") that monitors pipelines, scans for buying signals, and drafts personalized outreach 24/7. It's essentially an "Autonomous RevOps Team" that runs on my machine.

I want to show you this live tomorrow. I think it perfectly illustrates the difference between hiring a "salesperson" and deploying a "revenue engineer."

**Agenda for Tomorrow:**
1.  **The System Demo:** Showing you Basin::Nexus in action (it's wild).
2.  **The Opportunity:** How we plug this into TalSmart to create an unfair advantage.
3.  **The Structure:** My proposal for how we structure this so I can come onboard full-time and build this with you.

See you at 1:30 PM.

Best,

Leon Basin
