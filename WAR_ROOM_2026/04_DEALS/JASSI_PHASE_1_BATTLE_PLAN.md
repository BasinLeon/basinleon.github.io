# 🦅 PHASE 1: THE TALSMART SPRINT (JASSI PARTNERSHIP)

## 1. THE MISSION
**Objective:** Proven Revenue Model ($5k-$10k net profit in 30 days).
**The Target:** Sell **24 Units** of TalSmart Training (~$420/unit).
**The Role:** Co-Founder / Operate the "System".
**The Funding:** Jassi pays for Ads ($10k/mo) & Tech Stack.

## 2. IMMEDIATE LOGISTICS (Monday Morning)
*   [ ] **The Money Link:** Sign up for **FirstPromoter**. Get the affiliate tracking link from Jassi. *This is how you get paid.*
*   [ ] **The Tech Bill:** Send Jassi the invoice list for the stack. He pays, you operate.
    *   *Clay (Enterprise/Pro)*
    *   *Apollo (Data)*
    *   *Instantly/SmartLead (Sending)*
    *   *OpenAI API (Intelligence)*

## 3. THE "CREDIBILITY" ASSET
**The Resume Pivot:**
*   **Old Brand:** "Sales Representative" (Employee).
*   **New Brand:** "Revenue Architect" / "GTM Builder" (Partner).
*   **Action:** As soon as Jassi sends the **"Talisman Format"**, we strip the sales history and highlight the *Systems Built*.
*   *Note:* Even before the format arrives, we can draft the "Builder Narrative" (0 to 1 Accomplishments).

## 4. THE ENGINE (The Work)
**A. The "Mask" Campaign (The Recruiter Blast)**
*   **Strategy:** Email 40-50 Recruiters.
*   **The Hook:** "I have a candidate (Me/System) that can fix your client's sales problem." -> Leads to TalSmart Assessment.
*   **Action:** Write the "Recruiter Partnership" email template.

**B. The "Self-Checkout" Funnel**
*   **Current State:** Friction-heavy / Manual.
*   **Future State (The Nexus Flow):**
    1.  **Traffic:** Ads + Cold Email + Recruiter Referrals.
    2.  **Landing Page:** "Why Modern Sales Training Fails" (Agitation).
    3.  **Offer:** $20 Assessment (The Tripwire).
    4.  **Upsell:** Automated email sequence pushes the $420 Training.
    5.  **Checkout:** Stripe Link (Money in Bank).

## 5. THE ENDGAME (Phase 2)
*   **Trigger:** Consistent run rate on TalSmart.
*   **Reward:** **Section 1202 Equity** in CoachRobo.
*   **Why this matters:** Tax-free gains on the exit. This is the "Wealth" play, distinct from the "Cash" play.

---

**STATUS:**
*   **Gemini Analysis:** *RECEIVED & INTEGRATED.*
*   **Next Move:** Create the **Recruiter Email Template** and the **Tech Stack Invoice**.
