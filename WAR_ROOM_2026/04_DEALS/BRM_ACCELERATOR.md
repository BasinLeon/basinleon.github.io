# 🦅 EMAIL DRAFT: BRM LABS (MONDAY ACCELERATOR)

**To:** Lane Hartman, Tommy (BRM Labs)

**Subject:** Schedule Sync // James (CEO) Call

**Lane, Tommy,**

I’m moving into the final stages of a Founding GTM Mission with another Series A tech company on Monday afternoon. 

However, because of our alignment on the "March 5,000 Lead" engine and the work we’ve already mapped out, I’d like to prioritize the conversation with James.

Do we have 30 minutes on **Monday morning (between 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM PT)** to finalize the Q1 Strategy and discuss the permanent architecture deployment?

Let me know if we can lock that in before I head into my final sessions on Monday.

Best,
Leon
