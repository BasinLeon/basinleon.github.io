# Editorial + Distribution Operating System

## Journal-First Model

1. Home base: publish the full canonical post on this site.
2. Spokes: adapt for X, LinkedIn, Medium, and Substack.
3. Loop: all external posts link back to canonical.

## Canonical + Cross-Post Policy

- Publish here first.
- On Medium/Substack, include:
  - "Originally published at https://writing.basinleon.com"
- Keep one canonical URL per post.

## Weekly Distribution Routine

- Day 1: publish canonical post.
- Day 2: post X thread adaptation.
- Day 3: post LinkedIn angle.
- Day 4: post short Medium/Substack adaptation.
- Day 7: post recap with one key insight and link back.

## Visual Identity Rules

- Use one consistent headline pattern:
  - "How I [verb] [result] by [system/action]"
- Use one cover image style:
  - simple title block + system diagram/shape
- Keep typography and tone consistent across channels.

## Tracking Cadence

- Weekly:
  - top pages
  - referral sources
  - shares and saves
- Monthly:
  - top 3 topics to double down on
  - top 3 formats to improve or cut
