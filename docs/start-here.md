# Start Here

Welcome. This site is my canonical journal for GTM systems, revenue architecture, and AI-assisted operator workflows.

If you are new, use this path:

1. Read the [Frameworks](/frameworks/) page.
2. Review the [Top 20 First](/top-20/) idea priorities.
3. Browse [Topics](/topics/) based on your role.
4. Use the [Editorial OS](/editorial-os/) for the publish + distribution loop.
5. Use the [Share Kit](/share/) if you want to pass this to your team.

## Who This Is For

- GTM and RevOps leaders
- Founder-led sales teams
- Operators building AI-enabled systems
- Hiring managers assessing systems execution

## What You Will Get

- Practical models you can test in 7 days
- Playbooks with concrete operating steps
- Case-style writing tied to real execution decisions

## Canonical Post Policy

All original full-length posts are published here first.
Cross-posts on Medium/Substack/X/LinkedIn should point back to the canonical URL on this site.
