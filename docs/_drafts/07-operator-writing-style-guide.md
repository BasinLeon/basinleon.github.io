Hook: Good operator writing is clear, specific, and useful by default.

## Problem
- Most writing sounds polished but says very little.

## Insight
- Credibility rises when every paragraph adds new information.

## Method
- Use concrete examples.
- Cut generic openers.
- End each section with an actionable takeaway.

## Takeaway
Write to transfer decisions, not to perform intelligence.
