One-line hook: Most teams do not have a volume problem. They have an interpretation problem.

## Problem
- Where does your pipeline lose context between signal, owner, and next step?

## Insight
- Activity can rise while conversion confidence falls.
- Persuasion quality cannot compensate for routing ambiguity.

## Method
1. Define signal sources.
2. Define interpretation states.
3. Map each state to a route + owner.
4. Review misses weekly.

## Takeaway
If you cannot classify intent cleanly, more outreach only scales noise.
