Hook: Results matter, but causal clarity builds trust.

## Problem
- Many win stories report outcomes without explaining what changed.

## Insight
- Strong proof shows mechanism, not just metrics.

## Method
- State baseline.
- State intervention.
- State measurement window.
- State confounders.

## Takeaway
If you cannot explain why the outcome changed, the story is weak.
