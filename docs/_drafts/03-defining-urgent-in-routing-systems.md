Hook: "Urgent" should be an operating definition, not a feeling.

## Problem
- Teams tag too many records as urgent, then everything slows down.

## Insight
- Urgent requires explicit criteria and a time-bound owner action.

## Method
- Define urgent thresholds.
- Assign one owner and SLA.
- Enforce one required next-step field.

## Takeaway
If urgent is vague, it is useless.
