Hook: Not all signals are equal. Some predict motion. Others just create noise.

## Problem
- Teams over-index on easy-to-capture signals, not decision-relevant ones.

## Insight
- High-value signals often combine behavior + role context + problem language.

## Method
- List top 5 signal sources you use.
- Rank by: reliability, timeliness, and actionability.
- Keep only top 2 for pilot routing.

## Takeaway
Your system is only as good as the signal quality it trusts.
