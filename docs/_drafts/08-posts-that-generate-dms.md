Hook: Public engagement looks good. Private engagement closes loops.

## Problem
- Vanity engagement can mask low practical impact.

## Insight
- DMs usually come from specificity, utility, and relevance.

## Method
1. Lead with a concrete pain point.
2. Share one tactical framework.
3. End with a practical prompt for operators.

## Takeaway
If readers can apply it today, they are more likely to message you.
