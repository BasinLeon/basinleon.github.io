Hook: Distribution is not one post. It is a sequence.

## Problem
- Most posts are published once and abandoned.

## Insight
- A 24-hour sequence captures compounding exposure across channels.

## Method
- Hour 0: publish canonical post.
- Hour 2: share primary social teaser.
- Hour 6: share actionable excerpt.
- Hour 24: post recap + one new angle.

## Takeaway
Consistency in distribution beats one-time intensity.
