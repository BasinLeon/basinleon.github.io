Hook: Start where work is repetitive, high-frequency, and low judgment.

## Problem
- Teams automate visible tasks first, not bottleneck tasks first.

## Insight
- The best first automations reduce latency and increase consistency.

## Method
- Rank workflow steps by repetition and risk.
- Automate low-risk repeated steps first.
- Keep approval gates for high-risk actions.

## Takeaway
Automate for system reliability, not novelty.
