Hook: Lifecycle stages fail quietly before they fail visibly.

## Problem
- Stage definitions drift, ownership blurs, and next steps disappear.

## Insight
- Most breakdowns cluster into three buckets: definition, ownership, and handoff.

## Method
1. Audit stage definitions.
2. Audit owner clarity by stage.
3. Audit handoff latency and completeness.

## Takeaway
Fixing lifecycle design often creates faster gains than adding new tooling.
