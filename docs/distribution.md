Use this checklist after every post publish.

Full operating model:
- [Editorial + Distribution Operating System](/editorial-os/)

## Indexing Checklist

- Verify the post appears in `/sitemap.xml`.
- Verify the post appears in `/feed.xml`.
- Submit your site in:
  - [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)
  - [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/about)
- Request indexing for the new URL in both consoles.

## Distribution Checklist

- Share on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) with a native summary + link.
- Share on [X](https://x.com/) with a short hook + link.
- Republish/cross-post on:
  - [Medium](https://medium.com/)
  - [Substack](https://substack.com/)
- Add the post link to your portfolio/library pages.

## Canonical + Cross-Post Policy

- Publish full post here first (canonical URL).
- Republish adapted versions on Medium/Substack.
- Add this line to every cross-post:
  - "Originally published at https://writing.basinleon.com"
- Keep one canonical URL per article.

## Weekly Distribution Routine

- Day 1: publish canonical post.
- Day 2: publish X thread adaptation.
- Day 3: publish LinkedIn angle.
- Day 4: publish short Medium/Substack adaptation.
- Day 7: publish recap with one key insight and canonical link.

## Tracking Checklist

- Add UTM links when sharing externally (example):
  - `?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=blog_post`
- Enable one analytics provider:
  - `google_analytics` in `_config.yml`, or
  - `plausible_domain` in `_config.yml`
- Review top pages weekly and double down on topics with sustained reads.
