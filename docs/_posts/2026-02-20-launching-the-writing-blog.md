This is the first post on the new Jekyll blog.

I am using this site to publish clear, operator-grade writing on:

- GTM systems
- Revenue architecture
- AI workflow design

Publishing flow:

1. Add a markdown file in `_posts` with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
2. Commit and push to GitHub.
3. GitHub Pages builds and publishes automatically.
