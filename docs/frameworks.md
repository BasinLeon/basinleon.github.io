# Writing + Operator Frameworks

This is the consolidated framework library used across my writing, outreach, and publishing system.

## 1) LinkedIn DM Framework (4 lines)

1. Context: why this person, why now.
2. Insight: specific problem pattern for their role/stage.
3. Bridge: relevant proof from a similar context.
4. Low-friction ask: short call or permission-based follow-up.

Rules:
- no links in first message
- no pressure CTA
- keep first DM under 70 words when possible

## 2) Long-Form Viral Operator Template

Recommended structure:
1. Title with clear tension.
2. Opening with lived context.
3. What people are noticing (3 grounded observations).
4. What is actually changing.
5. Midpoint anchor quote.
6. Where execution breaks (real examples).
7. What changed for me.
8. Practical playbook readers can run this week.
9. Next phase thesis.
10. Memorable close line.

## 3) X Post / Thread Structure

1. Contrarian or clarifying opening line.
2. What I’m seeing.
3. Why it breaks.
4. What works now.
5. One practical prompt/question.

Principles:
- hook in first line
- 1 to 3 sentences per block
- prefer practical insight over generic motivation

## 4) Email Framework (Exec / Referral / Partner)

Format:
- appreciation line
- one-sentence update
- 2 to 4 bullets max
- single CTA with concrete next step
- grateful close

## 5) Resume Bullet Framework

Use: `impact + action + context`

Example pattern:
- Increased `outcome` by `%/value` by doing `specific action` in `specific context`.

## 6) Speaking / Interview Structure

Use: `context -> action -> result -> lesson`

Principles:
- short answer first, depth second
- no overclaiming
- keep tone grounded

## 7) Anti-Slop Lint (Pre-Publish)

- Can only I write this line?
- Did I remove generic filler?
- Did I include at least 2 concrete specifics?
- Does this sound natural out loud?
- Would this still feel credible to an expert reader?

## 8) Distribution Pairing (After Publish)

1. Primary post: short teaser + canonical link.
2. First reply: one actionable excerpt.
3. Same-day follow-up: one question for operators.
4. Next-day optional: what readers said + one clarification.

## 9) 3-Layer GTM Operating Model

1. Signal Intake
- capture role changes, engagement behavior, referrals, problem language

2. Intent Interpretation
- classify motion stage and urgency into explicit decision states

3. Routing
- map each state to a clear path and owner:
  - nurture
  - conversation
  - partner path
  - not now
  - urgent
