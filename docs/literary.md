# Literary Lane

This is the personal side of my writing.

Alongside systems and operator notes, I also publish reflective, human, and literary work:
- memory fragments
- city and travel sketches
- inner life essays
- voice-driven experiments

## How I Write Here

- Start with one true scene.
- Keep the language plain and vivid.
- Prefer specificity over abstraction.
- Let the emotion sit without over-explaining it.
