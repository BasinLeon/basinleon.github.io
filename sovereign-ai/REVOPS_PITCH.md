# 🦅 PITCH: REVOPS CO-OP GUEST POST
**Target:** editor@revops.coop
**Subject:** Guest Post Proposal: The Rise of Sovereign AI in Revenue Operations

Hi Editor,

I’ve been following RevOps Co-op’s focus on tech stack optimization. I have a practical, slightly controversial perspective to share with your audience:

**Topic: Moving from Rent-Seekers to Owners: Why RevOps Teams are Turning to Sovereign AI Stacks.**

In the last 6 months, AI costs for GTM teams have exploded. Every seat in ChatGPT or Claude is a tax on growth. More importantly, data privacy in a multi-tenant cloud environment is becoming a critical risk for firms handling sensitive client financial data.

I’ve recently implemented a **Sovereign AI Stack**—14 local LLMs running behind our firewall with $0 in API costs and 100% data privacy.

**I’d love to write a piece for you covering:**
1. The hidden costs of "cloud-first" AI in RevOps.
2. How to set up a local AI swarm (Scouts, Reasoners, Writers) for proprietary data.
3. A case study on cutting AI platform costs by 95% while increasing security.

I’ve built this architecture 100 times and would love to share the blueprint with the Co-op community.

Is this something your readers would find high-signal?

Best,
Baruch Basin
