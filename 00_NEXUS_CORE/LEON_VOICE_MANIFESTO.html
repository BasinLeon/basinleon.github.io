        <h1>Leon's Voice: The GTM Engineer</h1>
        
        <p>This isn't a script, Leon. This is your thesis. Read this to internalize **who you are** before the call. Forget the "STAR" method for a second—just speak the truth.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 1: THE OBSESSION -->
        <h2>01. The Obsession</h2>
        <span class="thought">Why do you do this?</span>
        <div class="voice-box">
            "Kelley, I’m obsessed with a very specific problem: **Human Latency.** 
            <br><br>
            I’ve spent 15 years at places like Google and Fudo, and I’ve seen million-dollar deals die—not because the product was bad, but because a hot signal (like a funding spike or a key hire) sat in a database for 48 hours for no reason. 
            <br><br>
            I build systems to kill that gap. I treat the revenue engine like code, which is why I call myself a **GTM Engineer**. I’m not here to manage tools; I’m here to architect the machine so the sales team doesn't have to do the manual grind."
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 2: THE NOMAD NARRATIVE -->
        <h2>02. The "Nomad" Truth</h2>
        <span class="thought">How do you explain the "hops" without sounding like a flight risk?</span>
        <div class="voice-box">
            "You’ll see a few moves on my resume, and I'll be honest with you: **I was looking for a role that didn't have a name yet.** 
            <br><br>
            I started in Ops at NetApp to see scale, but I got restless because I wanted to build, not just report. I moved into Growth at Fudo to build from scratch, and that's where I finally started writing Python to automate our pipeline. 
            <br><br>
            For the last year, I’ve been fractional because I was effectively **R&D-ing this role.** I’ve been testing my Signal Refineries across different industries to prove the architecture works. Now that Glean is hiring a 'GTM Engineer,' my search is over. I'm ready to take everything I've built and bring it in-house for a permanent home."
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 3: THE WAR STORIES -->
        <h2>03. The War Stories</h2>
        <span class="thought">Don't list bullet points. Tell the story of the "Signal Refinery."</span>
        <div class="voice-box">
            "At Fudo, we were coming into the US with zero footprint. We had 5,000 raw leads from a conference, and our reps were drowning. I didn't want to hire more SDRs; I wanted better signal. 
            <br><br>
            So I sat down and coded a Python refinery. I hooked into federal spend APIs and funding data, and I used AI to score who was actually ready to buy. We filtered 5,000 leads down to 100 high-intent targets in **sub-400ms**. 
            <br><br>
            That pivot generated **$2M in pipeline** and saved us over **$400K in labor.** That's when I realized I’m not a sales guy—I’m the guy who builds the pipes."
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 4: THE W4 REALITY -->
        <h2>04. Why Glean? (The Homecoming)</h2>
        <span class="thought">Why are you done with consulting?</span>
        <div class="voice-box">
            "Most people think GTM is just 'Volume.' Glean thinks it's **'Architecture.'** That’s why I'm here. I’m tired of moving from project to project as a vendor. I want to build a legacy engine at a place where the information problem is the core of the product. 
            <br><br>
            I want to be the technical backbone of this org. I’m ready to sign the W4 and make this my life’s work for the next 5 years."
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 5: PEER-TO-PEER QUESTIONS -->
        <h2>05. Peer-to-Peer Questions</h2>
        <span class="thought">Don't ask "What's the culture?" Ask builder questions.</span>
        <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
            <li>👉 "What was the specific friction point where Glean said, 'We need an Engineer for GTM, not just more Ops'?"</li>
            <li>👉 "If I start tomorrow, what's the one manual process you want me to kill with code in my first 30 days?"</li>
            <li>👉 "How much are we using our own AI product to fuel our own GTM? Are we drinking our own champagne?"</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- SECTION 6: RECRUITER CHECKLIST -->
        <h2>06. The Recruiter Checklist</h2>
        <span class="thought">The standard questions they need to "check off." Keep these tight.</span>

        <div class="voice-box">
            <strong>Q: Walk me through your background.</strong><br>
            "I started in enterprise Ops at NetApp and HP, then moved into Operations at Google Shopping. After that, I shifted into strategic sales at SurveyMonkey, managing a $300M enterprise portfolio. Then I ran the global BDR engine at Sense, where I personally closed the first $250K outbound deal in company history. Most recently, I led the US GTM build at Fudo Security—that's where I started writing Python to automate our pipeline. Across my career, I've architected systems that generated **$30M+ in aggregate pipeline.** For the last year, I've been in 'R&D mode' as a fractional architect, testing the Signal Refinery architecture across industries."
        </div>

        <div class="voice-box">
            <strong>Q: Why are you looking / Why did you leave?</strong><br>
            "I've been intentionally testing my GTM code in different industries as a fractional architect. Now that the category of 'GTM Engineer' has matured, I'm ready to bring the code in-house for a permanent home. I'm done with project-to-project work; I want to own one mission for the long term."
        </div>

        <div class="voice-box">
            <strong>Q: What are you looking for in your next role?</strong><br>
            "A 'Founding' or 'Architect'-level seat at a growth-stage tech company. I want to be the technical backbone of the GTM org—owning the systems, the code, and the pipeline infrastructure. I'm looking for a builder culture, not a 'manager of tools' culture."
        </div>

        <div class="voice-box">
            <strong>Q: What is your timeline?</strong><br>
            "I'm actively interviewing. If the role and team are right, I can start within 2-3 weeks."
        </div>

        <div class="voice-box">
            <strong>Q: What are your compensation expectations?</strong><br>
            "I'm targeting $180K-$220K base, depending on equity participation and the scope of the role. I'm flexible for the right mission fit."
        </div>

        <div class="voice-box">
            <strong>Q: Location / Remote?</strong><br>
            "I'm based in the Bay Area. Happy to do hybrid in San Francisco or full remote. I've led distributed teams globally and am comfortable working async."
        </div>

        <div class="voice-box">
            <strong>Q: Any concerns about the role?</strong><br>
            "My main question is around decision-making velocity. I want to make sure I'm joining a team that can ship fast and doesn't have multi-month approval cycles. The best environments I've worked in are ones where an engineer with an idea can ship it within a sprint."
        </div>

        <div class="footer">
            "Leon, you aren't an applicant. You're an Architect. Be yourself. It's enough." 🦾🛰️🦞
