            <h3>Your Filler Words to Eliminate</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>essentially</strong> — Say what it IS, not what it "essentially" is.</li>
                <li><strong>kind of</strong> — Replace with a specific number or fact.</li>
                <li><strong>you know</strong> — Delete entirely. They don't know. That's why you're telling them.</li>
                <li><strong>um / uh</strong> — Replace with a 2-second pause. Silence is powerful.</li>
                <li><strong>So, I...</strong> — Start with the verb. "I built..." not "So, I built..."</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Question 1: The High-Impact Project</h2>
            <p class="question">"Walk me through a high-impact GTM project you've worked on. What was the objective, and what did you build?"</p>
            <div class="context">Context: Kelley said the take-home will be about a "high-impact project." This is your chance to tell the Fudo Signal Engine story.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>The Setup (10 seconds):</strong></p>
                <p>"At Fudo Security, I was the first GTM hire in the Americas. The company had zero US pipeline and the founders had been doing everything themselves for 7 years."</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>The Problem (10 seconds):</strong></p>
                <p>"We had 5,000 raw leads from a conference, but no way to prioritize them. The reps were drowning in noise, and hiring more SDRs wasn't the answer."</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>The Build (20 seconds):</strong></p>
                <p>"I built a Python-based signal engine. It pulled data from federal spend APIs and funding databases, then used AI to score each lead based on compliance sector fit. The system filtered 5,000 leads down to 100 high-intent targets."</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>The Result (10 seconds):</strong></p>
                <p>"That engine generated $2M in pipeline over 2 years. We reduced the SDR team from 10 to 2 while increasing meeting volume. The automation saved $424K annually in operational costs."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h3>Delivery Tip</h3>
                <p>Practice this in under 60 seconds. Time yourself. If you go over, cut words, not speed.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Question 2: Your POV on AI in GTM</h2>
            <p class="question">"How would you implement AI into a day-to-day GTM workflow? What's your point of view?"</p>
            <div class="context">Context: Kelley said they want to see "a strong POV on how to implement AI into day-to-day workflow."</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>The Thesis (10 seconds):</strong></p>
                <p>"Most GTM teams use AI as a feature. I treat AI as the architecture. The difference is: features sit on top of broken processes. Architecture replaces the process entirely."</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>The Example (20 seconds):</strong></p>
                <p>"At Fudo, I used Gemini to create custom agents for SDR onboarding. Instead of training reps on how to research accounts manually, I built an agent that pulled the research for them. The SDR's job became reviewing and executing, not hunting."</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>The Glean Connection (15 seconds):</strong></p>
                <p>"Glean is the perfect environment for this. You're already building agents that can search and synthesize information. My job would be to take that capability and hard-wire it into the GTM motion, so the sales team never has to leave the Glean surface to get what they need."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h3>Delivery Tip</h3>
                <p>Use the phrase "architecture, not features." It's memorable and frames you as a builder.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Question 3: The First 30 Days</h2>
            <p class="question">"If you started tomorrow, what would you do in your first 30 days?"</p>
            <div class="context">Context: Kelley mentioned they need a "listening tour" to diagnose manual work. Glean has "data enrichment issues." This is your roadmap.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>Week 1: Listen</strong></p>
                <p>"I'd spend the first week on a listening tour. Sit with RevOps, pre-sales, post-sales, and marketing. My goal is to find the 3 most painful manual tasks that are burning hours every week."</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Week 2: Diagnose</strong></p>
                <p>"I'd map those pain points to the existing tech stack. Where is the data breaking? Where are the handoffs failing? I'd document the gaps between Salesforce, Apollo, and Clay."</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Week 3: Build a Quick Win</strong></p>
                <p>"I'd pick the single highest-impact, lowest-lift problem and build a working prototype. Maybe it's a Clay table that auto-enriches new leads from Salesforce. Something I can ship in 5 days."</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Week 4: Present</strong></p>
                <p>"I'd present the prototype to the team, get feedback, and use that to build a 90-day roadmap for the bigger architectural changes."</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip">
                <h3>Delivery Tip</h3>
                <p>This answer shows humility (listening first) and speed (shipping in Week 3). That's what they want.</p>

            <h2>Question 4: Why Glean?</h2>
            <p class="question">"Why do you want to work here? What excites you about Glean?"</p>
            <div class="context">Context: You already answered this well on the call. Tighten it up.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>"I've been looking for this title for years. 'GTM Engineer' is a category that barely existed until now. Most companies think GTM is about volume. Glean thinks it's about architecture."</p>
                <br>
                <p>"What excites me is the opportunity to use Glean's own product to power Glean's sales motion. Drinking your own champagne. If I can build agents that help the sales team sell faster, that's the most authentic proof point you could ask for."</p>
                <br>
                <p>"I'm done with fractional work. I want to own one mission for the next 5 years. Glean is that mission."</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Question 5: Technical Depth Check</h2>
            <p class="question">"Tell me about a complex workflow you've built. How does n8n integrate with Clay?"</p>
            <div class="context">Context: You stumbled on this during the Kelley call. Practice a clear, confident answer.</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>"I use n8n as the orchestration layer and Clay as the enrichment layer. They connect via webhook."</p>
                <br>
                <p>"Here's a real example: I built a pipeline monitor that triggers on new Salesforce opportunities. When a new opp is created, n8n fires a webhook to a Clay table. Clay enriches the account with firmographics and hiring data. Then n8n routes the enriched record back to Salesforce and sends a Slack alert to the AE."</p>
                <br>
                <p>"The whole flow runs in under 10 seconds. No human touches it until the alert lands."</p>
