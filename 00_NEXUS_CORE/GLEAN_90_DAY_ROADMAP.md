# GLEAN | 90-DAY GTM ARCHITECTURE ROADMAP
**Prepared for:** Kelley Fernandez & The Glean GTM Engineering Team
**Architect:** Leon Basin

## OBJECTIVE
Serve as the technical backbone of the GTM org. Shift the focus from manual data enrichment to a code-governed engine leveraging **Clay, n8n, and Glean Agents**.

## PHASE 1: THE CLAY FOUNDATION (DAYS 1-30)
* **Data Audit**: Diagnose current data/enrichment gaps. Map internal "Information Friction" points within the RevOps tech stack (Salesforce, Apollo, Gong).
* **Clay Ownership**: Centralize data enrichment loops within Clay. Build the first set of outbound signals targeting "Dark Social" and funding triggers.
* **Glean Integration**: Operationalize Glean-on-Glean agents to automate the research phase for the SDR layer.
* **KPI**: Reduce manual data enrichment time by 50% for core segments.

## PHASE 2: AI-FIRST WORKFLOWS (DAYS 31-60)
* **n8n Orchestration**: Connect Clay signal data to automated n8n workflows for multi-channel personalized outreach (LinkedIn + Email).
* **Signal Refinery**: Deploy keyword monitoring for technical communities to feed problem-aware leads directly into the SDR pipeline.
* **GTM Experiments**: Launch three high-velocity experiments targeting Series A/B Cyber firms using the "Reddit Air Strike" playbook.
* **KPI**: Deliver 15+ "Sales-Ready" SQLs via automated AI qualification.

## PHASE 3: SCALING THE ARCHITECTURE (DAYS 61-90)
* **Field Enablement**: Expand automated workflows into field sales and marketing to eliminate duplicate manual entry and "Cold" prospecting.
* **Architecture Briefing**: Create the real-time GTM Engineering Dashboard for executive visibility into pipeline velocity and signal efficiency.
* **Permanent Home**: Hard-code the proven playbooks into the GTM engine to ensure sub-5-day ramp time for new hires.
* **KPI**: Achieve 160% increase in validated pipeline velocity.

## THE PROOF
* **Clay Expert**: 2+ years of complex workflow orchestration.
* **GTM Engineer**: 88,000+ lines of revenue-focused code deployed.
* **ROI**: $424K in labor savings generated in previous Series A builds.

*"GTM is an information architecture problem. I build the engine that solves it."*
