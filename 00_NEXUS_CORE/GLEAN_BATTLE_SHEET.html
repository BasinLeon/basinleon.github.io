        <div class="key-point">
            🔥 KELLEY IS ALREADY SOLD. THIS CALL IS ABOUT: (1) Can you code? (2) Do you want W2? (3) Do you get scale?
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>1️⃣ INTRODUCTION (60 SECONDS)</h2>
            
            <div class="script-box">
                <span class="label">WHEN SHE SAYS: "Tell me about yourself"</span>
                "I'm a GTM Operations leader who builds systems, not just processes.
                <br><br>
                My background is in operations analysis at companies like NetApp and Sense, but over the last few years, I've been building what I call 'self-healing revenue engines'—automated GTM systems that kill manual work.
                <br><br>
                Most recently, I built a 'Signal Refinery' for a cybersecurity company. It's a Python system that takes 5,000 raw leads per month, enriches them using Clay and custom scrapers, scores them with AI, and routes the top 100 to sales via Slack.
                <br><br>
                The result: We went from 5,000 unqualified leads to 100 high-intent accounts, and the sales team closed $200K in new revenue.
                <br><br>
                When I saw the 'Founding GTM Engineer' role at Glean, it felt like the exact category I've been building in. Modern GTM isn't about configuring Salesforce fields—it's about building API-driven, AI-first systems that scale. That's what I do."
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 2: PROOF POINTS -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>2️⃣ PROOF POINTS (EXAMPLES)</h2>

                • AI agents (GPT-4 API for email drafting and pain point extraction)
                <br>
                • Automation workflows (AWS Lambda for serverless execution)
                <br><br>

                "100%. I've been consulting because I was looking for the right full-time home. I don't want to be a consultant—I want to own and build the internal engine for one company.
                <br><br>
                Glean is that company. I'm all-in. I want to be the person who builds the GTM infrastructure that scales you from $100M to $500M ARR."

                <br><br>
                The principles are the same whether you're selling to 100-person companies or 10,000-person companies. The difference is scale, and that's what I'm excited to learn.
                <br><br>
                At Fudo, I managed 5,000 leads/month. At Glean, it might be 50,000 leads/month. The architecture is the same—you just need better infrastructure. That's what I want to build."

                "Three reasons:
                <br><br>
                <strong>1. The Market:</strong> Enterprise AI search is massive. Every company is drowning in data. Glean is the only company that's nailed the 'Google for work' experience. Your customer list—Databricks, Confluent, Grammarly—tells me your product is real.
                <br><br>
                <strong>2. The Stage:</strong> You're Series D, $2.2B valuation, scaling fast. This is the exact stage where GTM infrastructure becomes critical. You can't scale from $100M to $500M ARR with manual processes. You need systems. That's what I build.
                <br><br>
                <strong>3. The Role:</strong> 'Founding GTM Engineer' is the exact category I've been building in. I don't want to be a Salesforce admin. I don't want to be a pure engineer who doesn't understand GTM. I want to be the bridge. That's this role."
