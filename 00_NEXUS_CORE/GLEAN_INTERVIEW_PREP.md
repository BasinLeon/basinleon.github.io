## 🛡️ INTERVIEW PREP: KEY TALKING POINTS

### 1. Opening Pitch (2 minutes)
**Question:** "Tell me about yourself and why you're interested in this role."

**Answer:**
"I'm a GTM Operations leader who thinks like an engineer. My background is in operations analysis at companies like NetApp and Sense, but over the last few years, I've been building what I call 'self-healing revenue engines'—automated GTM systems that eliminate manual toil.

Most recently, I built a 'Signal Refinery' for a cybersecurity company called Fudo Security. It's a Python-based system that ingests 5,000+ raw leads per month, enriches them using Clay and custom scrapers, scores them with AI, and routes the top 100 to the sales team via Slack. The result: We went from 5,000 unqualified leads to 100 high-intent accounts, and the sales team closed $200K in new revenue.

When I saw the 'Founding GTM Engineer' role at Glean, it felt like the exact category I've been building in. Modern GTM isn't about configuring Salesforce fields anymore—it's about building API-driven, AI-first systems that scale. That's what I do, and that's what Glean needs."

### 2. Technical Depth: Clay + Enrichment
**Question:** "Walk me through your Clay experience."

**Answer:**
"I use Clay as the orchestration layer for lead enrichment. Here's my typical workflow:

1. **Ingest:** I pull leads from multiple sources (LinkedIn, Apollo, USASpending.gov for federal contracts) into Clay tables.
2. **Enrich:** I use Clay's native enrichments (Clearbit, Apollo, etc.) plus custom Python scrapers I've built. For example, I wrote a scraper that pulls funding data from Crunchbase and news signals from Google News API.
3. **Score:** I send the enriched data to a Python scoring algorithm (hosted on AWS Lambda) that uses a simple ML model to predict 'likelihood to buy' based on signals like recent funding, tech stack, and job changes.
4. **Route:** High-scoring leads get pushed to Salesforce and Slack. Low-scoring leads go to a nurture campaign in HubSpot.

The key is that Clay is just the orchestration layer. The real magic happens in the custom Python logic I've built around it."

### 3. AI-First GTM Automation
**Question:** "How do you think about AI in GTM?"

**Answer:**
"I think about AI in GTM in three layers:

**Layer 1: Enrichment** - AI helps you gather better data. For example, I use GPT-4 to analyze company websites and extract 'pain points' that sales can use in outreach.

**Layer 2: Scoring** - AI helps you prioritize. I've built a lead scoring model that uses historical win/loss data to predict which leads are most likely to convert. It's not perfect, but it's 70% accurate, which is way better than random.

**Layer 3: Execution** - AI helps you act. For example, I've built an AI agent that drafts personalized outreach emails based on the enriched data. The SDR just reviews and sends.

The mistake most companies make is they try to jump straight to Layer 3 (AI writes all the emails!) without nailing Layer 1 and 2. You need clean data and smart prioritization before you can automate execution."

### 4. Handling the "Spotty Career" Question
**Question:** "I see you've had a few short stints. What's the story there?"

**Answer:**
"Great question. Here's the honest story:

From 2018-2020, I was building my foundation in operations and sales at companies like Sense and NetApp while completing my MBA. I was intentionally exploring different aspects of GTM.

In 2020, I joined Fudo Security as their first US sales hire. This was a European company trying to break into the US market, and I was responsible for building the entire GTM strategy from scratch. Over two years, I took them from zero to $2M in pipeline and closed $200K in revenue. Unfortunately, they decided to shut down the US operation in 2022 after the market shifted—not uncommon for European vendors trying to crack the US.

Since then, I've been doing fractional consulting while looking for the right full-time home. I've worked with companies like Brain Trust and a sales training firm, but I realized I don't want to be a consultant—I want to be part of a team, owning and building the internal engine.

That's why I'm here. Glean is at the exact stage where you need someone to build the GTM infrastructure that scales you from $100M to $500M ARR. I want to be that person."

---

### 5. Why Glean?
**Question:** "Why Glean specifically?"

**Answer:**
"Three reasons:

**1. The Market:** Enterprise AI search is a massive opportunity. Every company is drowning in data, and Glean is the only company that's nailed the 'Google for work' experience. I've seen your customer list—Databricks, Confluent, Grammarly—these are best-in-class companies. That tells me your product is real.

**2. The Stage:** You're Series D, $2.2B valuation, scaling fast. This is the exact stage where GTM infrastructure becomes critical. You can't scale from $100M to $500M ARR with manual processes. You need systems. That's what I build.

**3. The Role:** 'Founding GTM Engineer' is the exact category I've been building in. I don't want to be a Salesforce admin. I don't want to be a pure engineer who doesn't understand GTM. I want to be the bridge—the person who builds the technical backbone of the GTM org. That's this role."

### 6. Questions to Ask Kelley
**Show you've done your homework and understand the business:**

1. **"What's the biggest GTM bottleneck right now?"**
   - Listen for: Manual processes, lead quality, sales efficiency, data cleanliness
   
2. **"How does Glean think about PLG vs. enterprise sales?"**
   - Listen for: Are they moving upmarket? Do they have a self-serve motion?
   
3. **"What does success look like for this role in the first 90 days?"**
   - Listen for: Specific projects, metrics, stakeholders
   
4. **"Who would I be working with most closely?"**
   - Listen for: RevOps, Sales, Marketing, Engineering
   
5. **"What's the tech stack for GTM right now?"**
   - Listen for: Salesforce, HubSpot, Clay, Outreach, etc.
   
6. **"How does Glean use its own product internally for GTM?"**
   - This is a power move—shows you're thinking about product-market fit

## 🛡️ POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS & HOW TO HANDLE

### Objection 1: "You don't have enterprise SaaS experience"
**Response:**
"That's fair. My background is in mid-market cybersecurity and recruiting tech. But here's what I do have: I've built the exact systems Glean needs—Clay workflows, AI-powered lead scoring, automated enrichment pipelines. The principles are the same whether you're selling to 100-person companies or 10,000-person companies. The difference is scale, and that's what I'm excited to learn."

### Objection 2: "You've been consulting for a while. Are you committed to W2?"
**Response:**
"100%. I've been consulting because I was looking for the right full-time home. I don't want to be a consultant—I want to own and build the internal engine for one company. Glean is that company. I'm all-in."

### Objection 3: "This role requires deep technical skills. Can you code?"
**Response:**
"Yes. I write Python daily. I've built scrapers, APIs, scoring models, and automation workflows. I'm not a software engineer—I'm a GTM engineer. I write code to solve GTM problems, not to build products. That's the exact skill set this role needs."

---

## 🎯 CLOSING STATEMENT

**When Kelley asks: "Do you have any final questions?"**

**Say this:**
"Just one. I've been building 'GTM engineering' as a category for the last few years, and this is the first time I've seen a company actually hire for it as a role. It feels like Glean is ahead of the curve here. What made you decide to create this position now?"

**Then close with:**
"I'm really excited about this. Glean is at the exact stage where GTM infrastructure becomes a competitive advantage. I want to be the person who builds that. Let's make this happen."
