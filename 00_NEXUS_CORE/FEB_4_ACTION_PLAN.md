**Lavi Message:**
```
Subject: Congrats on the momentum!

Lavi, congrats on the Upwind momentum post-Series B.

I saw you're leading Growth after scaling Spot.io through the NetApp acquisition. That's the exact transition I'm fascinated by—taking a high-velocity startup engine and making it work at enterprise scale without losing speed.

I'm a GTM Operations leader (formerly Ops Analyst at NetApp) who's spent the last few years building automated systems that give sales teams their time back. Most recently, I built a system that helped a cyber team book 100+ qualified calls in 12 days. My focus is on the 'invisible infrastructure'—the stuff that makes a CRO's life 40% easier.

I'm looking for my next W2 role where I can own and build these systems internally. Would you be open to a quick call to discuss what the Upwind growth engine needs as you scale?

**Max Message:**
```
Subject: Re: Scaling global sales ops

Max, saw you're leading sales at Upwind post-Series B. Congrats on the momentum.

I'm a GTM Ops leader who's built automated pipeline systems for cybersecurity teams. My background is in operations analysis (NetApp era), and I've spent the last few years engineering systems that eliminate the manual grind for sales teams.

Most recently: Built a lead qualification engine that helped a team book 100+ calls in 12 days by automating the prospecting layer.

I'm looking for my next W2 role where I can own and scale these systems internally. Would love to discuss how Upwind is thinking about sales ops as you scale globally.

**George Message:**
```
Subject: Re: GTM Expansion

George, I saw RapidFort's Series A news and the explicit focus on "Go-to-Market Expansion." That's exactly the type of challenge I'm built for.

I'm a GTM Operations leader who's spent the last few years building repeatable growth systems for cybersecurity companies. My background is in operations analysis, and I've architected automated engines that turn chaotic growth into predictable pipeline.

Most recently: Built a lead refinery system that helped a cyber team go from 5,000 raw leads to 100 qualified accounts—then closed $200K in new revenue.

I'm looking for my next W2 role where I can own and build the expansion engine. Would you be open to a quick call to discuss what RapidFort needs as you scale?
```

**Mehran Message:**
```
Subject: Engineering logic for GTM

Mehran, congrats on the $42M Series A. I've been following RapidFort's approach to software supply chain security—it's a massive market.

I'm a GTM Operations leader who thinks like an engineer. My background is in operations analysis (NetApp), and I've spent the last few years building automated growth systems that apply engineering logic to sales operations.

The thesis: Most GTM teams are still running on manual processes. I build the systems that make growth repeatable and scalable.

I'm looking for my next W2 role where I can own and architect the internal growth engine. Would love to discuss how RapidFort is thinking about GTM as you scale.

### **Orion Security (1 Message)**
- [ ] **Nitay Milner** (CEO) - "AI-First GTM" angle

**Nitay Message:**
```
Subject: AI agents in GTM

Nitay, congrats on the $32M Series A for Orion. I've been following the AI-driven data security space closely—it's the future.

I'm a GTM Operations leader who's been building AI-powered sales systems for cybersecurity companies. My background is in operations analysis, and I've spent the last few years engineering systems that use AI agents to automate the prospecting and qualification layer.

The result: Sales teams get their time back to focus on closing, not prospecting.

I'm looking for my next W2 role where I can own and build these AI-first systems internally. Would you be open to a quick call to discuss how Orion is thinking about GTM as you scale?

**Chris Message:**
```
Subject: Operationalizing $31M in growth

Chris, congrats on the $31M Series A for RADICL. Building a virtual SOC for SMBs in regulated sectors is a massive opportunity.

I'm a GTM Operations leader who specializes in operationalizing growth for cybersecurity companies. My background is in operations analysis, and I've built automated systems that help teams scale without burning out.

Most recently: Architected a lead refinery that helped a cyber team go from 5,000 raw leads to 100 qualified accounts in regulated sectors.

I'm looking for my next W2 role where I can own and build the internal growth engine. Would love to discuss what RADICL needs as you scale.
```

**Dave Message:**
```
Subject: High-agency outreach for SMBs

Dave, I saw you're leading revenue at RADICL. Congrats on the Series A.

I'm a GTM Operations leader who's built high-agency outreach systems for cybersecurity companies targeting regulated sectors. My background is in operations analysis, and I specialize in building systems that convert in high-compliance environments.

The challenge with SMBs: You need high volume, but you can't sacrifice quality. I build the systems that solve this.

I'm looking for my next W2 role where I can own and scale these systems internally. Would you be open to a quick call?

Subject: Scaling trust via systems

Daniel, congrats on the $26M Series B for Veremark. Scaling background checks globally is a massive operational challenge.

I'm a GTM Operations leader who specializes in building zero-loss pipeline systems. My background is in operations analysis, and I've architected growth engines that scale without leaking opportunities.

Most recently: Built a lead management system that helped a team manage 5,000+ leads with zero loss and 100+ qualified conversions.

I'm looking for my next W2 role where I can own and build the internal growth engine. Would love to discuss how Veremark is thinking about scaling globally.

**James Follow-up:**
```
Subject: Thanks for the call today

James, thanks for the time today. Really enjoyed the conversation about GTM engineering and the challenges you're facing at BRM.

I've been thinking about the "pockets of product-market fit" challenge you mentioned. That's exactly the type of problem I love solving—taking raw signal and turning it into a repeatable engine.

I'd love to send over a quick one-pager on how I'd approach the ICP dialing and conversion optimization for BRM. Would that be helpful?

Looking forward to staying in touch.

## 🛡️ PRIORITY 3: PREPARE FOR "SPOTTY CAREER" OBJECTION

### **The Honest Narrative (Practice This):**

**Question:** "I see you've had several short stints. Walk me through your career path."

**Answer:**
"Great question. Here's the honest story:

From 2018-2020, I was building my foundation in operations and sales at companies like Sense and NetApp. I was also completing my MBA during this time, which is why you see some shorter stints—I was intentionally exploring different aspects of GTM while in school.

In 2020, I joined Fudo Security as their first US sales hire. This was a European company trying to break into the US market, and I was responsible for building the entire GTM strategy from scratch. Over two years, I took them from zero to $2M in pipeline and closed $200K in revenue. Unfortunately, they decided to shut down the US operation in 2022 after the market shifted—not uncommon for European vendors trying to crack the US.

Since then, I've been doing fractional consulting while looking for the right full-time home. I've worked with companies like Brain Trust and a sales training firm, but I realized I don't want to be a consultant—I want to be part of a team, owning and building the internal engine.

That's why I'm here. I'm looking for a W2 role where I can take everything I've learned—the automation, the systems thinking, the ops rigor—and apply it to one company's growth for the long term."

### **Key Principles:**
1. **Own it** - Don't apologize, but don't hide it either
2. **Context** - MBA explains the early exploration
3. **Fudo** - Frame as a success (built from zero) that ended due to market forces, not performance
4. **Consulting** - Frame as intentional exploration, not desperation
5. **Future** - Make it clear you want stability and ownership now
