# 🦅 Ola's Daily Hunting Protocol & KPIs

Ola,
We are shifting gears. To secure opportunities quickly, we need to hit specific volume targets every single day.
This is not about "checking boxes." It is about **Pipeline Velocity**.

### **Daily KPIs (Non-Negotiable)**
*   **20 Applications:** submit 20 high-quality applications daily (LinkedIn, Wellfound, BuiltIn).
*   **5 Direct Outbounds:** DM 5 Hiring Managers/Founders for the roles you applied to.
*   **5 New Prospects:** Add 5 new potential companies to the CRM (Tier 1 Targets).
*   **2 Conversations:** Aim to secure 2 responses or "conversations" per day (even if just a "Send me info").

### **The "Hunter" Routine**
**Morning (8:00 AM - 10:00 AM): The Application Sprint**
1.  Open the "Job Board List" (Wellfound, BuiltIn, WeWorkRemotely).
2.  Filter for: `Chief of Staff`, `Head of Operations`, `Operations Manager`.
3.  **Apply to 20 roles.** Don't overthink the cover letter. Use the "Technical Brief" if they ask for work samples.

**Mid-Day (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM): The DM Attack**
1.  Go to the LinkedIn Company Page for the 5 best roles you applied to.
2.  Find the CEO or Founder.
3.  **Send the DM Script:**
    > "Hi [Name], just applied for the Ops role.
    > I’m a Revenue Architect currently scaling a $2M pipeline. I don't just 'manage' ops; I build sovereign engines.
    > Wanted to flag my app directly. - Leon"

**Afternoon (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM): CRM Hygiene**
1.  Log all 20 apps in the 'Tracking' sheet.
2.  Mark any active conversations as "In Progress."

### **Resource Kit**
*   **Resume/Profile:** Ensure Wellfound & LinkedIn are updated (I will provide the copy).
*   **Asset:** Use the *Wholesaler Extraction Brief* as a "Work Sample" if they ask for proof of competence.
*   **Scheduling:** Use my Calendly Link: `https://calendly.com/lbasin23`

**Let's hunt.**
