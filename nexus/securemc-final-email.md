Subject: The 90-Day Scaling Roadmap (Automating the Search)

Moaz,

Following up on our session. I understand the "leap" involved in moving from manual work to automation.

To give you and your partner clarity on *exactly* how we execute this transformation, I’ve prepared two documents:

1.  **The Blueprint (Attached):** The technical logic of *how* we find 500+ leads/month.
2.  **The 30-60-90 Day Plan (Attached):** The timeline of execution.

**Highlights of the Roadmap:**
*   **Day 1-30:** We install the scrapers. You stop manual LinkedIn searching. Target: 150+ Leads.
*   **Day 31-60:** We speed it up. Leads hit your dialer in <15 mins. Target: 300+ Leads.
*   **Day 61-90:** We optimize based on *closed deals*. Target: 500+ Qualified Signals/Mo.

**The "Automation Dividend"**
By automating just the "Search" phase (20% of the work), we free up 100% of your leadership time to focus on closing.

**Proposed Term:**
*   **Growth Pilot:** $2,000/mo (Month-to-Month).
*   *Note: This includes the full extraction engine setup and data management.*

I’m ready to launch the Pilot to prove this Model in the first 30 days.

Best,

Leon

**P.S.** Regarding the closing: Once we stabilize the lead flow (Month 2), I am happy to discuss a separate "Closer's Retainer" to help your team negotiate the final contracts. Let's fix the pipeline supply first.
