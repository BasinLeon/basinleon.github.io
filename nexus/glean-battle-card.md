# 🦅 GLEAN BATTLE CARD: Founding GTM Engineer

**OPPORTUNITY:** Founding GTM Engineer (Hybrid/Remote)
**RECRUITER:** Kelley Fernandez (Hiring GTM Talent @ Glean)
**THE BRAND:** Leon Basin — The Revenue Architect & GTM Engineer

---

## 🎯 1. THE "GLEAN" THESIS
Glean is the category leader in **Enterprise AI Search**. They index the "Internal Signal" of a company.
**Your Counter-Thesis:** "You search the internal signal; I engineer the external refinery. Together, we create a closed-loop revenue engine where market intent (External) meets company context (Internal)."

## 🛠️ 2. TOP 3 "WEAPONS" FOR THIS CALL
1.  **Clay + Python Mastery:** Kelley specifically mentioned "Owning Clay." You don't just "use" Clay; you extend it with Python webhooks to handle logic that Clay can't (The Signal Refinery).
2.  **The "Founding" Mindset:** They aren't looking for a RevOps person to fix Salesforce. They are looking for an **Engineer** to build the technical backbone. Emphasize that you write code to kill manual work.
3.  **Revenue Integrity:** Use the "Sovereign Funnel" and "Logic Gates" language. It signals that you treat GTM as a rigorous engineering discipline, not a series of "best practices."

## 🗣️ 3. THE "IMPECCABLE TIMING" SCRIPT
*   "Kelley, when you reached out, I was actually in VS Code refining a Python script that uses Clay webhooks to route Whale leads in <200ms."
*   "Modern GTM isn't about configuring fields; it's about building **API-driven, self-healing engines**. I'm not here to manage your stack—I'm here to engineer it."
*   "I see Glean as the 'Brain' of the enterprise. I want to build the 'Sensor Array' (GTM Engine) that feeds that brain with high-intent revenue signals."
