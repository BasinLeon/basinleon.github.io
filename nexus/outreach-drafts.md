**Subject**: Re: Strategy Sync // Friday

Hi Katia,

Friday 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM PST works perfectly for the strategy session with Daniel. I've locked it on my end.

To make the most of our time, I've attached a **Strategic Engagement Framework** (v2.1). It outlines the two specific models we discussed (Strategic Partner vs. Founding Executive) and maps the transition from your current manual sourcing to the "Sovereign" architecture.

Please share this with Daniel as a pre-read. We’ll use it to drive the decision on Friday.

See you then,
Leon

### 2. RODNEY / KALINA (The Bridge)
**Channel**: SMS / LinkedIn DM
**Context**: Rodney offered an intro to Kalina (expanding network).

"Hey Rodney - thanks for thinking of me regarding Kalina. I’m currently vetting 2 partners for a 'Sovereign GTM' pilot closer to the venture side. Since you mentioned she's building, it might be a good timing match. Happy to run a 15-min signal audit for her if she's open to it. Can you drop us a group text?"

### 3. SECUREMC (The Pilot)
**Channel**: Email
**Context**: Addressed "Sticker Shock". Shift to Pilot.

**Subject**: Growth Pilot Protocol: Wholesaler Extraction

[Name],

Reflecting on our chat—we don't need a full retainer yet. We need a win.

I’m proposing a **30-Day Growth Pilot** ($2k).
Goal: Prove we can automate your Wholesaler identification at scale.

**The Deliverable:**
1.  **Signal Injection**: I will identify and score 2,000 active Wholesalers hiring Acquisition Managers.
2.  **Enrichment**: 100% verified mobile numbers and email vectors.
3.  **Handoff**: Delivered directly to your CRM for immediate calling.

If this generates < 5 deals, we stop. If it works, we scale.
Ready to launch this week?

Leon
