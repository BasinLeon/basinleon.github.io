# 🦅 The Outreach Protocol for Ola

Ola, great work today.
To scale, I need you to take ownership of the "Meeting Setup" phase.
I will handle the Strategy & Architecture. You handle the Outreach & Scheduling.

### **The Goal**
Your job is to get **5 Qualified Wholesalers** on my calendar every week.

---

### **Step 1: The 'Warm' List (Start Here)**
I have identified 5 companies actively hiring Acquisition Managers right now. These are "High Signal" targets because they have deal flow but need sales help.

**Target List:**
1.  **Story Homes** (Team Lead - Investment Sales)
2.  **M2 Solutions** (Acquisitions Manager)
3.  **Diego Buys Houses** (Acquisitions Manager)
4.  **MRW Home Buyers** (Acquisition Specialist)
5.  **First Choice Home Sale** (Acquisitions Specialist)

---

### **Step 2: The Action Script**
You are not "applying for a job." You are offering a partnership.
Find the Owner/CEO on LinkedIn.

**The DM Script:**
> "Hi [Name], saw you're hiring an Acquisition Manager.
>
> We run a dedicated 'Wholesaler Extraction Engine' that feeds verified off-market leads directly to acquisition teams. Instead of hiring another rep to *find* deals, we can feed your current team 100+ vetted signals/month.
>
> My partner Leon (Revenue Architect) would like to show you the system. Open to a 15-min demo?"

---

### **Step 3: The Handoff**
*   **If they say YES:** "Great. Here is Leon's calendar: **https://calendly.com/lbasin23**. He will show you the backend of the extraction engine."
*   **If they ask for info:** Send them the *Intelligence Brief* one-pager.

**Your KPI:** Book 1 demo by Friday.
