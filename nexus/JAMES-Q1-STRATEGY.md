# Q1 GTM Architecture: The "Signal Engine"
**Prepared For:** James McGillicuddy & Lane Hartman (BRM.ai)
**Date:** February 3, 2026

---

## The Objective
Transition from "Manual Verification" to "Automated Signal" ahead of the March data influx (5,000+ leads from the Metrics sponsorship). The primary goal is to eliminate "smooshiness" in the raw data and isolate High-Value Personas with technical precision.

## Phase 1: The Ingestion Engine (Weeks 1-4)
**Focus:** Preparation for the 5,000 "Metrics" Sponsorship Leads.

*   **The Challenge:** We anticipate ~5,000 high-quality leads in early March. Manual triage by a single headcount is operationally inefficient; we require a system to surface high-intent signals within minutes of ingestion.
*   **The Solution (Basin::Nexus Logic Gate):**
    *   **Enrichment Swarm:** Deploy the Python Signal Refinery to scan the 5,000 domains immediately upon lead receipt.
    *   **The "Tech Stack" Filter:** Score every lead based on their current technology stack. Specifically, identify users of Coupa, Netsuite, Brex, or Ramp (high-intent signals for the BRM "Vendor Management" wedge).
    *   **The Output:** De-smoosh the lead list to isolate the "Top 100" High-Probability Accounts for direct engagement by the CEO and sales leadership. Remaining leads (approx. 4,900) will be routed to an automated, role-specific nurture loop.

## Phase 2: The "Watering Hole" Strategy (Weeks 5-8)
**Focus:** Maximizing ROI on Finance Dinners & SIG/ProcureCon Events.

*   **The Thesis:** Procurement is a relationship-driven market. We must engage targets in high-intent environments, arriving prepared with Pre-Event Intelligence.
*   **Execution:**
    *   **Event Recon:** For SIG and ProcureCon, we will analyze attendee lists pre-event to identify "Vendor Managers" at Target Accounts (e.g., TD Ameritrade, Amazon).
    *   **Pre-Event Targeting:** Secure "consultative audits" before the formal event commencement.
    *   **Strategic Narrative:** Align engagement around Risk, Compliance, and Governance (e.g., SOC 2, DPAs) to move upstream into the enterprise layer.

---

## Phase 3: The Content Loop (Weeks 9-12)
**Focus:** Transforming "Guide" Downloads into Qualified Conversations.

*   **The Upgrade:** Automate the post-download sequence based on the prospect's organizational role and technical profile.
*   **Segmented Logic:**
    *   **IT and Security:** Focus on "Read-Only" contract ingestion and safety protocols.
    *   **Finance and Procurement:** Focus on "Contracted vs. Actual" payment reconciliation and unit economics.

## Summary
The objective is to move beyond traditional marketing and engineer a system that manufactures predictable revenue. We are prepared to deploy the infrastructure required to process the March influx and focus resources on the high-intent personas identified as the key growth wedge for BRM.ai.

**Next Milestone:** Technical review of the Python lead filtration logic later this week.
