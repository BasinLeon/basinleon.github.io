# 🎙️ JAMES MCGILLICUDDY (BRM.ai) - CEO BATTLE CARD
**Objective:** Secure "Revenue Architect" role for Q1.
**Vibe:** Senior Architect. Precise. Zero fluff.

---

## 1. THE OPENING (Low-Volume)
"James – Looking forward to this. I've been refining the architecture for the March influx of 5,000 leads we discussed. Ready to dive into the plan."

## 2. THE CORE (March Event Logic)
"The goal is simple: We need to solve for **Signal Latency**.
1. **Filter:** Immediate check for high-intent signals (e.g., Coupa/Brex usage).
2. **Enrich:** Identify the 'Category Manager' responsible for SaaS spend.
3. **Route:** The **Top 10% (High-Value Accounts)** hit Slack in real-time (< 2 mins). Everyone else goes to automated nurture.
*This eliminates the 48-hour void where leads usually go cold.*"

## 3. CEO STRATEGY QUESTIONS (Go Deep)
*   "James, where is your biggest friction point right now? Is it **product adoption** or getting the market to understand the **use case**?"
*   "With the 5,000 leads in March—what is the 'Success Metric' for you? Is it meetings booked, or qualified pipeline yield?"
*   "How are you currently preventing 'Shelfware' post-purchase? Are we tracking customer value realization?"

## 4. THE CEO LENS (Unit Economics)
*   **Labor:** "I want to move you from a world of **Headcount** ( hiring more SDRs) to a world of **Architecture**. One Engineer replaces a 3-person team."
*   **Scale:** "This system is built in Python. It doesn't get tired and it doesn't decay. It scales as fast as your event list grows."
