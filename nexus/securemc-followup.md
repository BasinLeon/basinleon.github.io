Subject: Blueprint for Advisor Review: Automating the Investor Search

Ola,

Following up on our strategy session.

I’ve mapped out the exact **"Automated Acquisition Protocol"** we discussed. This is the document to share with your advisor/partner.

**It answers the core question:**
*"How do we move from 20 manual leads/month to 500+ without hiring more staff?"*

**Attached: `securemc-blueprint.html`**

**The 30-Second Summary for your Partner:**
1.  **The Problem:** Your current team is stuck manually searching for data (LinkedIn/Reddit), which is unscalable.
2.  **The Solution:** I am installing an "Extraction Engine" that automatically mines Real Estate Wholesalers & Flippers.
3.  **The Result:** Your team stops searching and starts dialing 100% of the time.

Let me know once you’ve reviewed this with the team. I’m ready to deploy the scrapers as soon as we greenlight the pilot.

Best,

Leon
