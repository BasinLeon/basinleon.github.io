**To the Hiring Team at Tenable,**

I am writing to apply for the **Customer Success Manager** role. As a Customer Success and Implementation Lead with over 10 years of experience managing enterprise accounts for technical companies, I see Tenable as the critical infrastructure for the modern enterprise's survival.

Most Customer Success Managers are reactive—they wait for a support ticket or a cancellation notice before they act. I operate differently. I focus on **proactive** relationship management to ensure clients get value immediately.

In my recent work, I have focused on:
1.  **Accelerating Time-to-Value:** I don't just "onboard" clients; I create clear 30-60-90 day deployment plans that ensure they use the product correctly from Day 1.
2.  **Proactive Retention:** I monitor usage data closely to catch "at-risk" accounts weeks before they become a problem, allowing me to intervene and save the renewal.
3.  **Technical Fluency:** I bridge the gap between complex technical products and the non-technical stakeholders who sign the checks.

Tenable’s mission to help organizations “understand and reduce cyber risk” resonates with my approach: **Solving problems before they happen.** I want to bring my operational discipline and relentless focus on client outcomes to your team.

I am ready to deploy immediately and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can help Tenable secure and expand its most critical accounts.

Respectfully,

**Leon Basin**
