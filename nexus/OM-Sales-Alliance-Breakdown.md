# PROPOSAL: Fractional GTM Engineering Alliance
**Partner:** OM-Sales (Oleksandr Mosin, Ph.D., LL.M.)
**Architect:** Basin::Nexus (Leon Basin)
**Status:** Strategic Alignment Phase

---

## 1. The Executive Summary

OM-Sales has successfully scaled cybersecurity vendors (Sectona, Syteca) to $5M+ ARR. However, scaling this volume manually requires hiring BDRs, Pre-Sales, and Data Specialists. 

**Basin::Nexus** solves this by fulfilling these functions via an automated **Sovereign GTM Layer**, allowing Oleksandr to focus on high-level "tête à tête" negotiations without the overhead of human management debt. As a fellow Ukrainian, Leon is committed to proving that Ukrainian specialized knowledge can lead the world in **Product-Led GTM Engineering**.

## 2. The Solution: Fractional GTM Engineering

We eliminate the friction of slow hiring cycles by deploying the **Nexus Engine** to manage the technical and operational flow of the OM-Sales portfolio.

### A. The BDR Function (Before Sales)
*   **The Problem:** Signal firehose from 450+ partners causes lead decay.
*   **Nexus Fix:** The **Signal Refinery** automates the qualification of incoming partner leads. Replaces the need for a manual BDR hire.

### B. The Pre-Sales/Data Function (After Sales)
*   **The Problem:** Startups end up as 'shelfware' if value isn't created post-purchase.
*   **Nexus Fix:** Automated **POC Telemetry** ensures customers actually utilize the software. Replaces the need for a Pre-Sales/Data Specialist hire.

## 3. Tiered Deployment Models (Solving for Flow)

To ensure immediate momentum while de-risking the engagement, we propose two paths:

### Option A: The "Managed Pilot" (Entry Node)
*   **Scope:** Deployment of Basin::Nexus for **two specific vendors** in your portfolio.
*   **Deliverables:** Automated BDR qualification + POC telemetry for those two nodes.
*   **Investment:** **$2,500 / month** (Cost-neutral compared to a part-time junior).
*   **Goal:** Prove the "No Shelfware" results within 45 days.

### Option B: The "Portfolio Architecture" (Total Scale)
*   **Scope:** Full-cycle GTM Engineering for the **entire OM-Sales ecosystem**.
*   **Deliverables:** Total Autonomous BDR + Pre-Sales layer for all portfolio vendors + Content Pilot.
*   **Investment:** **$5,000 / month**.
*   **Goal:** Replace the need for an entire 3-person GTM operations team.

## 4. Why This Works (Mission Alignment)

VCs (Squared Circle, Bright Pixel) prefer Option A because it allows them to see the **System-Led** ROI on their highest-potential investments first. More importantly, this partnership demonstrates the level of **Revenue Architecture** required to transition Ukraine from an "Outsourcing Hub" to a "Product Powerhouse."
