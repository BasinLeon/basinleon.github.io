# Outreach Campaign: Oleksandr Mosin (Alliance Protocol)

## Step 1: LinkedIn Transition (The "Take-it-Offline" Reply)

**Leon:**
"Oleksandr – Your philosophy on 'Before vs After' sales and your vision for Ukraine as the next Silicon Valley resonates deeply with me, not just as a GTM Engineer, but on a personal level as a fellow Ukrainian. We need more product-led thinking to move beyond the outsourcing model.

I’ve prepared a **2-page Architectural Breakdown** that shows how I can solve your currently open **BDR and Pre-Sales Engineering** needs using the Basin::Nexus engine. This would allow me to focus 100% on scaling the OM-Sales ecosystem with you on a monthly basis.

I have your email as **oleksandr.mosin@om-sales.com** – I’ll send the breakdown and some times for Thursday over there now."

## Step 2: The Formal Email Proposal

**To:** oleksandr.mosin@om-sales.com
**Subject:** Alliance Blueprint: Solving the 'Shelfware' Problem via GTM Architecture

**Oleksandr,**

It was refreshing to see your posts on why Ukraine is the next Silicon Valley. As a fellow Ukrainian, I share that exact mission—transitioning our local specialized knowledge from the "software development supply chain" into a sovereign, product-led economy. 

As a Sorbonne Ph.D. and LL.M, you understand that scaling a global channel isn't just a sales effort—it's a compliance and engineering challenge. Most GTM teams 'choke' on the 450+ partner firehose because they solve it with human headcount, leading to the exact 'shelfware' problem you described.

**The Proposal: Fractional GTM Engineering**

Instead of you hiring three separate roles (BDR, Pre-Sales, Data Specialist), I am proposing to step in as your **Lead GTM Engineer** for a fixed monthly retainer. I will use the **Basin::Nexus** engine to fulfill these functions:

1.  **The BDR Function ('Before' Sales)**: My **Signal Refinery** will automate the discovery and qualification of your partners. I’ll ensure no signal decays and you only walk into high-intent 'tête à tête' negotiations.
2.  **The Pre-Sales / Data Function ('After' Sales)**: I will architect the **POC Telemetry** layer for your vendors. This prevents the 'shelfware' trap by hard-coding 'Value Creation' into the deployment process.
3.  **The Silicon Valley Content Hub**: I’ll auto-generate technical blogs and documentation from the system’s telemetry to support your vision of a product-startup economy in Ukraine.

**The Commercial Logic (Solving for Momentum):**
To move this off commission-only waiting cycles and ensure I can dedicate 100% of my focus to our shared mission, I am proposing a **Managed Pilot** at a tiered investment:

*   **Managed Pilot ($2,500/mo)**: I deploy the Basin::Nexus architecture to manage the BDR/Pre-Sales flow for **your top two vendors**. This is cost-neutral compared to a part-time junior hire, but provides full high-fidelity automation.
*   **Portfolio Architecture ($5,000/mo)**: Scaling the engine to the entire OM-Sales ecosystem once the pilot proves ROI.

**I have attached the full 2-page Breakdown here:**

Are you open to a discovery call on Thursday to see how we can initiate a **Pilot Node** and start building this product-led future together?

Best regards,

**Leon Basin**
