# 🦅 The Hunter's Checklist: Where to Find "Whales" (Not Jobs)

**Context:**
Ola, stop searching for "Remote Jobs." That is a crowded market where you beg for work.
We are looking for **Real Estate Wholesalers** and **Investors**. These are people with money who need help finding deals. We don't ask for jobs; we offer *deal flow*.

### **1. The Identity**
*   **Name to use:** Moaz Darwish (if representing the firm) or your own name if scouting.
*   **Email for Signups:** `bizservices@securemandc.com` (Use this so we own the account).

---

### **2. Facebook Groups (The Gold Mine)**
*Stop joining "Work from Home" groups. Join these instead:*

**Search ONLY these exact terms:**
1.  "Real Estate Wholesaling Systems"
2.  "Wholesaling Houses Elite"
3.  "ClickFunnels for Real Estate"
4.  "Creative Real Estate Finance"
5.  "Off Market Real Estate Deals [USA/State Name]"

**The Strategy:**
*   Don't post spam.
*   Look for people asking: *"How do I find more leads?"* or *"My VAs suck."*
*   **Reply:** "We run a dedicated Cold Calling engine for wholesalers. We don't use random VAs; we build the system. DM me."

---

### **3. Telegram Channels**
*Search these keywords in the global search:*
1.  `realestate`
2.  `wholesaling`
3.  `grant cardone` (his followers are our target)
4.  `biggerpockets`

---

### **4. Reddit (The Secret Weapon)**
*Go to these Subreddits:*
*   `r/RealEstateInvesting`
*   `r/WholesalingHouses`
*   `r/RealEstateTechnology`

**Action:**
Find posts complaining about "Lead Quality" or "Cold Calling."
**DM Script:** "Saw your post about bad leads. We manually target active funds for deal flow. Happy to share our list strategy."

---

### **5. Immediate Task**
Tonight: Join 5 Facebook Groups from the list above. Find **ONE** person complaining about leads and screenshot it to me.
