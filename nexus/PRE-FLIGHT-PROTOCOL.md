# 🦅 THE ARCHITECT'S PRE-FLIGHT PROTOCOL (25-MIN)
**Target:** James McGillicuddy (BRM.ai) | **Time:** 11:00 AM

---

## 1. THE OPENING: THE "WHAT" (DIAGRAM 01)
*Focus on the Q1 Plan PDF. James's headache: 5,000 March Leads.*

*   **The Goal:** Show you aren't just "hiring humans"; you are protecting his event ROI.
*   **The Line:** *"James, I wanted to walk you through the Q1 plan I drafted. With 5,000 leads hitting in March, we can't rely on manual research. This architecture ensures we catch the best signals instantly."*

## 2. THE BRIDGE: THE "HOW" (DIAGRAM 02)
*Focus on the Signal Refinery. Prove you are an Engineer.*

*   **The Transition:** *"Now, how does that actually work under the hood? We use a Signal Refinery model."* (Point to Python icon).
*   **The Line:** *"We set up 'listeners' that catch the signal before it decays. The logic gate scores the account and routes Priority Accounts to your team in under 2 minutes. It replaces hours of manual research with pure logic."*

## 3. THE CLOSER: THE "DYNAMIC" (EYE CONTACT)
*Stop Screen Sharing. Change the power dynamic.*

*   **The Power Move:** *"James, forget the tech for a second. What is your #1 SUCCESS METRIC for March? Is it just 'leads' or is it actual pipeline yield?"*
*   **The "Why":** This proves you care about his board-level metrics, not just "doing a task."

## 🛠️ FINAL CHECKLIST
*   [ ] **The Code:** Keep `analyze_targeted_leads.py` open. If he asks if you actually code, Alt-Tab and say: *"Yeah, I build it in Python to keep the latency low."*
*   [ ] **The Math:** Remember: Leads decay by **~18.5% every hour**.
*   [ ] **The Pitch:** "Filter. Enrich. Route. Real-time."
*   [ ] **Hydrate:** Drink water now. Steady voice win deals.

**"Trust the diagrams. Trust the logic. You are the Architect. Go win."**
