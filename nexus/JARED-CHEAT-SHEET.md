# 🎙️ JARED ROBIN (REVGENIUS) - INTERVIEW CHEAT SHEET
**Theme:** The Death of the SDR & Rise of the GTM Engineer
**Vibe:** Provocative, Technical, Visionary

---

## 1. THE OPENING SALVO (RE-FRAMING)
*   **The Problem:** "Jared, GTM is currently stuck in a **Headcount Trap**. We solve revenue problems by throwing entry-level humans at manual tasks. It’s expensive, slow, and mathematically doomed."
*   **The Re-Frame:** "I don't build sequences; I build **Logic Gates**. I’m moving my focus from *generating content* to *capturing signal*."

## 2. THE THREE "DEEP INSIGHTS" (HEAVY HITTERS)
*   **The 18.5% Hourly Decay Rule:** "Every hour a lead sits in a CRM without an autonomous response, its value drops by ~18%. Most SDRs have a 24-hour latency. By then, the lead is basically fossilized. My architecture aims for **< 120-second capture**."
*   **Protocol over Process:** "A 'Process' is a set of instructions for a human to follow poorly. A **'Protocol'** is a set of logic gates for a system to follow perfectly. Nexus is about building the protocols, not the training manuals."
*   **The "Signal Engineer" Persona:** "The future of sales isn't the 'Hustler'; it's the **Signal Engineer**. This is a person who understands Python listeners, enrichment APIs, and intent scoring. One Engineer replaces three SDRs and delivers 5x the pipeline."

## 3. THE "BEYOND GEN-AI" ANGLE
*   "Everyone is using ChatGPT to write better spam. That’s just making the problem louder. I’m using LLMs as a **reasoning layer** to decide *if* we should even send the email. It’s about **Sovereign Filters**, not Content Generation."

## 4. THE NEAT EXIT (THE VISION)
*   "My goal is simple: I want to help founders transition from a **Software Development Supply Chain** to a **Sovereign Product Economy**. That starts with engineering the revenue engine, not just 'selling' more stuff."
