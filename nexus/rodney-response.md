### RODNEY RESPONSE STRATEGY
**Status**: Received intro request for Kalina.
**Goal**: Accept the intro, but position yourself as a high-value asset ("The Architect"), not just another networker.

**Option 1: The Sovereign Builder (Recommended)**
*Professional, warm, but focused on "building".*

"Hey Rodney - great to hear from you. Always happy to connect with builders expanding their networks.

You can share my number: **(408) 933-8269**.

I'm currently heads-down architecting GTM engines for a few partners, so I'm vetting conversations carefully, but if Kalina is as driven as you say, I'd love to hear what she's working on. Appreciate the bridge!"

**Option 2: The Direct Networker**
*Short and sweet.*

"Hi Rodney! Thanks for the kind words and the intro.

My number is **(408) 933-8269**.

Please introduce us via text whenever you're ready. Looking forward to meeting her."

**Option 3: The "Signal" Pivot (Aggressive)**
*Pivoting immediately to business value.*

"Hi Rodney, thanks for thinking of me.

My number is **(408) 933-8269**.

If Kalina is expanding, she likely needs better signal intelligence. I'm currently running pilots for 'Sovereign GTM' systems—happy to give her a 15-min audit of her current stack if she's open to it. 

Talk soon."
