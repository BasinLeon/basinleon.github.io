# 🎙️ INTERVIEW BATTLE CARD: TUESDAY FEB 3RD

## 1. BRM.ai (James McGillicuddy - CEO) @ 11:00 AM
**Context:** Founders Call. Reconnecting after illness.
**Goal:** Prove you are a "Builder" who can drive GTM for their AI tool.

### 🗣️ The Pitch ("The Architect")
*   "James, I apologize for the delay - I was down, but the engine wasn't. While I was recovering, my automated systems were still sourcing leads."
*   "I see BRM.ai not just as a tool, but as the *infrastructure* for the modern Revenue Architect."
*   "I don't just 'use' AI. I build the **workflows** that make AI useful. Your tool is the engine; I build the roads."

### 🎨 The Visual to Flash
*   **The "Wholesaler Extraction" Logic (SecureMC).**
*   *Why:* Shows you solve specific, high-value business problems (finding hidden leads), not just generic "chatgpt" stuff.
*   *Narrative:* "For a client, we needed to find 500 hidden wholesalers. Humans couldn't do it. I built a Python script to 'triangulate' them via dark social signals. That's the power of automation."

### ❓ The Ask
*   "Where is your biggest friction point right now? Is it product adoption or getting people to understand the *use case*?"

## 2. RevGenius (Jared Robin) @ 1:30 PM
**Context:** Newsletter Feature (40k Audience).
**Goal:** Position yourself as a "GTM Engineer" / Thought Leader.

### 🗣️ The Hook ("The Operator")
*   "Jared, everyone on LinkedIn posts 'Theory.' I post 'Code'."
*   "I believe the SDR role isn't dying; it's practically dead. It's being replaced by **Signal Engineers**."

### 🎨 The Visual to Flash
*   **The "Signal Refinery" Architecture (The TalSmart Diagram).**
*   *Why:* It looks complex, proprietary, and "Enterprise-Grade." It screams "This guy has a Framework."
*   *The Framework:*
    1.  **Injest:** Raw Data (LinkedIn, Intent).
    2.  **Refine:** Python/LLM Scoring (The "Brain").
    3.  **Activate:** Automated Outreach (The "Hand").

### 🏆 The "Measurable Improvement" (For his article)
*   **Problem:** "Manual SDRs wasting 40 hours/week searching for emails."
*   **Solution:** "Built a 'Signal Engine' that scrapes and scores leads automatically."
*   **Result:** "10x Lead Volume. 0 Burnout. API bills < $50/mo."
