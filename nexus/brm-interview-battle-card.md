**Date:** Tuesday, Feb 3rd @ 11:00 AM PST
**Goal:** Transition from "Candidate" to "Architect."

## 🧠 THE CEO MINDSET (JAMES)
*   **The Visionary Powerhouse:** Stanford Athlete, ex-Carta Strategy (Henry Ward’s right hand). He doesn’t want an employee; he wants a **partner in execution**.
*   **The Term:** He loves **"Context Engineering"**. (Use it 3+ times).
*   **The Philosophy:** He hates "DAC Overlords" and manual spreadsheets. He believes in "Small teams with singularity of purpose."
*   **The Hook:** He is a history buff (Genghis Khan/Alexander the Great). He respects **strategy that changes the rules of the field**.

## 🗣️ THE "MAD SCIENTIST" SCRIPT
### 1. The Setup (The First 5 Minutes)
*   "James, I’ve been heads-down with Lane auditing the Q1 roadmap. The 5,000 leads coming in March is a massive opportunity, but it’s also a massive risk if we don't have the **Context Engineering** layer ready to filter them."
*   "Lane calls me the 'Mad Scientist' because I don't believe in manual research. I believe in **Logic Gates**."

### 2. The Move (Sharing the Visual)
*   **Flash the Q1 Architecture One-Pager.**
*   "This is my blueprint for the March influx. We aren’t just 'sending emails.' We are mapping the **Contractual Truth to the Real-Time Truth** (his exact phrase from LinkedIn)."

### 3. The 30-Day Execution Plan
*   **Days 1-7 (The Audit):** Wire up the Python enrichment layer to the lead source. Map the "Whale" signals (e.g., Brex/Coupa/Procurement headcount).
*   **Days 8-14 (The Pilot):** Run a "Signal Scrape" for the upcoming Finance Dinners. Give AEs the dossier entries before they walk in the room.
*   **Days 15-30 (The Engine):** Full automation of the "March 5,000" pipeline. Goal: Reduce "Time to Context" from 48 hours to < 200ms.

## ❓ THREE KILLER QUESTIONS FOR JAMES
1.  "James, you’ve talked about **Context Engineering** being the future of AI Agents. In our GTM motion, are we prioritizing *more* data, or *higher-fidelity* data for the AEs right now?"
2.  "You mentioned in your story that small teams with a 'Singularity of Purpose' are the strongest. What is the one mission-critical goal for this role in the first 90 days?"
3.  "I noticed your focus on 'Rising up against the CAC overlords.' To do that, we have to move faster than the market. Are you ready for a GTM motion that relies on **Code/Automation** rather than SDR headcount?"

## 🦅 PRO FLEX
*   If he asks about your "Skills": "I don't just 'use' tools. I build them. I’m currently running my own job search using the same **Basin::Nexus** engine I want to plug into BRM. It’s a zero-latency system."
*   **Energy:** High, Crisp, "Founder Mode."

**YOU ARE THE ARCHITECT. BUILD THE MISSION.** 🚀
