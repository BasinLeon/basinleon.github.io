        <p><strong>Most GTM teams run experiments. Few turn them into systems.</strong></p>
        
        <p>I spent 15+ years building revenue systems, and I've learned one thing: the difference between a one-off win and scalable growth is <strong>systemization</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Here's the framework I used to turn experiments into a scalable pipeline across multiple opportunities—and how you can apply it.</p>

        <h2>The Framework: Experiment → Measure → Systemize → Scale</h2>
        
        <p>This isn't theory. It's the process I used to build a GTM engine from scratch at a Series A cybersecurity company. Here's how it works:</p>
        
        <h3>Phase 1: Experiment</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Run small, focused experiments to test hypotheses.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>Example: The "Reddit Air Strike"</strong></p>
        
        <p>I ran a "secret shopper" experiment on Reddit to test a hypothesis: <em>Problem-aware buyers discuss their challenges publicly before they're solution-aware.</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>The Experiment:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitored technical forums (Reddit, HN, Stack Overflow) for problem discussions</li>
            <li>Engaged as a "secret shopper" to validate messaging</li>
            <li>Measured response rates and lead quality</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>The Result:</strong> 3 high-value, problem-aware leads in 48 hours. Messaging validated. Hypothesis confirmed.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Don't scale what you haven't validated. Run experiments first, measure results, then decide what to systemize.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Phase 2: Measure</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Track what actually works, not what feels good.</strong></p>
        
        <p>For the Reddit Air Strike, I measured:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lead Quality:</strong> Were they problem-aware? (Yes: 100%)</li>
            <li><strong>Response Rate:</strong> How many engaged? (3 out of 5 = 60%)</li>
            <li><strong>Time to Engagement:</strong> How fast? (48 hours)</li>
            <li><strong>Conversion Potential:</strong> Did they fit ICP? (Yes: 3/3)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>The Metric That Mattered:</strong> 60% response rate vs. 2-3% for generic cold email. That's a 20x improvement.</p>
        
        <h3>Phase 3: Systemize</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Turn the experiment into a repeatable play.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Once I validated the Reddit Air Strike worked, I systemized it:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Created Scripts:</strong> Tailored messaging for different problem types</li>
            <li><strong>Built Process:</strong> Defined signal sources, engagement criteria, follow-up sequence</li>
            <li><strong>Documented Play:</strong> Wrote playbook with step-by-step instructions</li>
            <li><strong>Set Metrics:</strong> Defined success criteria (response rate, lead quality, conversion)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>The System:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Monitor forums for problem-aware discussions</li>
            <li>Score leads based on ICP fit and problem awareness</li>
            <li>Engage with tailored messaging</li>
            <li>Track results and iterate</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Phase 4: Scale</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Delegate to the team and automate what you can.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Once systemized, I scaled the Reddit Air Strike:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Delegated to SDR:</strong> Trained them on the play, gave them scripts</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Detection:</strong> Built Python scripts to monitor forums automatically</li>
            <li><strong>Scaled Sources:</strong> Expanded from Reddit to HN, Stack Overflow, X/Twitter</li>
            <li><strong>Measured at Scale:</strong> Tracked results across all channels</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>The Result:</strong> What started as a one-off experiment became a repeatable play generating 15+ leads per week.</p>
        
        <h2>Real Examples: How I Applied This Framework</h2>
        
        <h3>Example 1: X/Twitter Drippi Campaign</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Experiment:</strong> Automated DMs on X/Twitter to engage technical audiences</p>
        <p><strong>Measure:</strong> 15+ technical conversations, 1 lead to proposal stage, 1 key meeting booked</p>
        <p><strong>Systemize:</strong> Created DM templates, defined target personas, set engagement criteria</p>
        <p><strong>Scale:</strong> Automated detection, delegated to SDR, scaled across multiple accounts</p>
        
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Ongoing pipeline generation from social channels</p>
        
        <h3>Example 2: SE Proactive Engagement</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Experiment:</strong> Sales Engineer engaging in public forums to establish thought leadership</p>
        <p><strong>Measure:</strong> Inbound technical leads, brand recognition, meeting bookings</p>
        <p><strong>Systemize:</strong> Created engagement playbook, defined forums, set posting schedule</p>
        <p><strong>Scale:</strong> Expanded to multiple SEs, automated content suggestions</p>
        
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Consistent inbound technical leads</p>
        
        <h3>Example 3: Closed-Lost Campaign</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Experiment:</strong> Re-engage historical closed-lost opportunities with new asset (analyst report)</p>
        <p><strong>Measure:</strong> Re-engagement rate, meeting bookings, pipeline value</p>
        <p><strong>Systemize:</strong> Created asset library, defined re-engagement criteria, built sequence</p>
        <p><strong>Scale:</strong> Automated asset distribution, delegated to SDR, tracked results</p>
        
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Re-activated $100K+ in pipeline</p>
        
        <h2>The Pipeline: How Systemization Built Scale</h2>
        
        <p>By systemizing experiments, I built a significant pipeline across 25+ opportunities:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple in Qualification:</strong> High-value opportunities in discovery</li>
            <li><strong>Several in Negotiation:</strong> Deals moving toward close</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple in PoC:</strong> Proof of concept stage</li>
            <li><strong>Others in Various Stages:</strong> Pipeline across the funnel</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Each systemized play contributed to the pipeline. No single play did it all—but together, they built a scalable engine.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Apply This Framework</h2>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Run Experiments</h3>
        
        <p>Start small. Test one hypothesis at a time. Don't try to scale before you validate.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Questions to Ask:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>What hypothesis am I testing?</li>
            <li>How will I measure success?</li>
            <li>What's the minimum viable experiment?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Measure Results</h3>
        
        <p>Track what actually works. Not what feels good. Not what you hope works. What actually works.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Metrics That Matter:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Response rates (vs. baseline)</li>
            <li>Lead quality (ICP fit, problem awareness)</li>
            <li>Conversion rates (experiment → meeting → pipeline)</li>
            <li>Time to result (how fast does it work?)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Systemize What Works</h3>
        
        <p>Turn successful experiments into repeatable plays. Document the process. Create scripts. Define metrics.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What to Systemize:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scripts and messaging</li>
            <li>Process and workflow</li>
            <li>Success criteria</li>
            <li>Tools and automation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Scale Through Delegation and Automation</h3>
        
        <p>Once systemized, scale it. Delegate to the team. Automate what you can. Measure at scale.</p>
        
        <p><strong>How to Scale:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Train team on the play</li>
            <li>Automate detection and enrichment</li>
            <li>Expand to new channels/sources</li>
            <li>Track results and iterate</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The "Mad Scientist" Approach</h2>
        
        <p>I call this the "Mad Scientist" approach: run experiments, measure results, systemize what works, scale what scales.</p>
        
        <p>It's not about being perfect. It's about being systematic. Every experiment teaches you something. Every systemized play builds your engine.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>The Key Insight:</strong> GTM isn't about running one perfect campaign. It's about building a system that turns experiments into repeatable plays that scale.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>What This Means for You</h2>
        
        <p>If you're running GTM experiments, you're already halfway there. The question is: are you systemizing what works?</p>
        
        <p><strong>Start Here:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Look at your last 3 experiments</li>
            <li>Which one worked best? (highest response rate, best leads, fastest results)</li>
            <li>Systemize it: create scripts, document process, define metrics</li>
            <li>Scale it: delegate to team, automate what you can, measure at scale</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>That's how you build a GTM engine. Not with one perfect campaign. With a system that turns experiments into repeatable plays.</p>
        
        <div class="cta-box">
            <h3>Want to Build Your Own GTM System?</h3>
            <p>I've built systems that replaced 10 SDRs ($424K savings) and grew pipeline 160%. If you're building GTM systems, let's connect.</p>
