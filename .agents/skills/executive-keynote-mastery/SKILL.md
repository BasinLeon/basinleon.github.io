# Executive Keynote Mastery

## When to Use This Skill
- Preparing for **Hiring Manager interviews** (e.g., Glean, BRM Labs)
- Rehearsing for **Guest Lectures** (e.g., SCU presentation)
- Crafting **Keynote speeches** or investor pitches
- Practicing in the **Dojo** to eliminate filler words and project confidence

## The Three Pillars of Executive Presence

### 1. BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front) — The Minto Pyramid
**Never lead with the story. Lead with the Result.**

Structure every answer as:
1. **HEADLINE**: The one-sentence conclusion. (e.g., "I generated $2M in pipeline.")
2. **SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS**: 2-3 pillars that prove the headline.
3. **EVIDENCE**: Specific data, metrics, and stories.

**Anti-Pattern:** Starting with "So, I was working at..." (Buries the lead)
**Correct:** "I architected a signal refinery that replaced 10 SDRs with 2 associates. Here's how."

---

### 2. STARK Narrative Structure
An upgrade to the classic STAR framework. Always end with **Knowledge Transfer**.

| Element | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **S - Situation** | Set the stage (15 seconds max) | "At Fudo, the team was drowning in 5,000 unqualified leads." |
| **T - Task** | What was your specific mandate? | "I was brought in to build an automated qualification engine." |
| **A - Action** | What did YOU do? Use strong verbs. | "I architected a Python-native signal refinery using Clay and n8n." |
| **R - Result** | Quantify the outcome. | "We generated $2M in pipeline and cut manual labor by $424K/year." |
| **K - Knowledge** | What is the architectural insight? | "The key insight: volume-based GTM is dead. Signal fidelity is everything." |

**Leon's STARK Verbs (Use These):**
- Architected, Engineered, Deployed, Refined, Scaled, Automated, Integrated

**Verbs to Avoid:**
- Helped, Was part of, Contributed to, Worked on

### 3. Vocal Delivery & Cadence

#### Target WPM: 120-140
- **Below 100 WPM:** You're dragging. Pick up the pace.
- **100-120 WPM:** Calm authority. Good for complex technical points.
- **120-140 WPM:** Optimal "Executive Presence" zone. Confident, not rushed.
- **Above 150 WPM:** You're nervous. Slow down. Breathe.

#### The 2-Second Pause
After delivering a major metric (e.g., "$30M pipeline"), pause for 2 full seconds. Let it land.

#### Filler Words: The Kill List
These must be eliminated from your vocabulary:
- "Essentially"
- "Kind of" / "Sort of"
- "You know"
- "Basically"
- "I mean"
- "Right?"
- "So, I..."
- "Um" / "Uh" / "Like"

**The Fix:** When you feel a filler coming, replace it with a **pause**. A pause sounds confident; a filler sounds uncertain.

## Pre-Presentation Checklist

Before any high-stakes presentation, run this checklist:

- [ ] **BLUF Verified:** Does my opening sentence contain the primary result?
- [ ] **Metrics Hardened:** Do I have at least 3 specific numbers memorized?
- [ ] **STARK Ready:** Have I practiced my top 3 stories in STARK format?
- [ ] **Filler Audit:** Have I done a 2-minute Dojo run with 0 fillers?
- [ ] **Pace Check:** Am I in the 120-140 WPM zone?
- [ ] **Architect Voice:** Am I using "I architected/engineered" instead of "We did"?

## The "Nightmare Mode" Drill

For adversarial interview practice, use this prompt in the Dojo:

> "You are a skeptical VP of Sales who has seen 100 'RevOps consultants' fail. Challenge my claims. Demand specifics. If I use a filler word, cut me off and say 'FILLER.' If my answer is vague, say 'PROVE IT.' Do not be polite."

## Bottom Line

An executive is not someone who talks more. An executive is someone who **commands the room with fewer, more precise words.**

Lead with the result. Back it with data. End with the insight. 

**You are the Architect. Speak like one.**
