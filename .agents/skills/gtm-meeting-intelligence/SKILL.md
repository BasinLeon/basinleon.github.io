# GTM Meeting Intelligence

## Overview

Arrive prepared for high-stakes revenue conversations with structured intelligence. This skill helps you bridge technical logic with executive value.

## The Process

### 1. Recon & Intelligence Gathering
- **Target Analysis**: Who are you meeting? Search LinkedIn, Twitter, and company blogs for their recent "Product/GTM" stances.
- **Problem Detection**: Identify specific bottlenecks (e.g., "Manual SDR hiring," "Broken PLG loop," "High signal latency").
- **Proof Alignment**: Match the user's "NEXUS" assets (case studies, scripts, dashboards) to the target's specific pain.

### 2. Narrative Anchors (The Pitch)
- **The "Invisible Ledger"**: Position GTM as a code problem, not a volume problem.
- **The "Signal Refinery"**: Explain how to ingest market movement and convert it to revenue in milliseconds.
- **Technical Proof**: Refer back to the "$424k labor replacement" or "160% pipeline growth" numbers.

### 3. The Battle Card Generation
Create a markdown document (e.g., `05_DEAL_KITS/<TARGET>_BATTLE_CARD.md`) covering:
- **The Hook**: A 30-second opening statement that disrupts their current GTM thinking.
- **3 Critical Questions**: High-status questions that demonstrate architectural depth.
- **The Demo Plan**: Selection of code snippets or dashboards to "leak" during the call.
- **Objection Handling**: Defensive logic for common questions (e.g., "Why not just buy more leads?").

## Key Principles

- **Architecture over Arithmetic**: Focus on systemic fixes, not incremental gains.
- **Technical Authority**: Don't just talk sales; talk about Python listeners, logic gates, and signal refineries.
- **High-Status Anchoring**: Don't ask for permission to pitch; identify a flaw and offer the fix.
- **Zero Latency**: Emphasize speed and automation as the ultimate competitive advantage.
