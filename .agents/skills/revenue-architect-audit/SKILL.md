# Revenue Architect Audit

## Overview

Convert cold targets into warm paths by presenting an analysis of their visible business systems. This skill focuses on finding "The Vacuum" or "The Pivot" in their GTM motion.

## The Process

### 1. Signal Recon (Public Data)
- **Hiring Signals**: Are they hiring 5-10 SDRs? (Trigger: THE AGENTIC PLAY).
- **Tech Stack**: Use BuiltWith or LinkedIn to find if they are using legacy SFDC/HubSpot without automation.
- **Funding/Stage**: Are they Series A/B? (Trigger: THE VACUUM).
- **Content Signals**: Search for Founder podcasts or LinkedIn posts about "scaling friction."

### 2. Diagnosis (Finding the Deviance)
- Identify where "Human Latency" is slowing them down.
- Calculate potential savings using the "Basin::ROI Framework" (e.g., SDR Headcount vs. Python-native Signal Refinery).
- Map their current bottleneck to one of the **NEXUS Triggers**:
    - **THE_VACUUM**: Funded but no revenue infrastructure.
    - **THE_PIVOT**: Shifting from PLG to Enterprise.
    - **THE_AGENTIC_PLAY**: Trying to solve automation with human labor.

### 3. The Speculative Audit Report
Generate a summary document (stored in `05_DEAL_KITS/SPECULATIVE_AUDITS/`) that includes:
- **Current Observation**: "You are launching missions with erring O-rings (e.g., 0.05% reply rates)."
- **The Gap**: Quantifiable efficiency loss (e.g., "18% lead decay per hour").
- **The Architecture Fix**: A high-level description of the Signal Refinery needed.
- **The Call to Action**: "I’ve built the blueprint for this. Ready to see the logic?"

## Key Principles

- **Value-First**: Give them the diagnosis before asking for the meeting.
- **Precision over Volume**: Audit 5 companies deeply rather than DM'ing 100 shallowly.
- **Engineered Realism**: Use real numbers (Reply lift, ramp time reduction) to anchor the audit.
- **Authority Positioning**: Speak as a peer architect, not a vendor.
