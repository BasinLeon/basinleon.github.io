# ENGINEERING AGREEMENT: THE GLOBAL INNOVATION BRIDGE
**BETWEEN: Basin::Nexus (San Francisco)**  
**AND: Ratuza AI (Dhaka)**

---

### 1. STRATEGIC ARCHITECTURE
This partnership is designed to eliminate **Human Latency** at a global scale. By bridging Silicon Valley's signal intelligence with Dhaka's technical implementation ecosystem, we create a zero-friction path for $100K+ ARR enterprise deals.

| ENTITY | REGION | ROLE | ASSET |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basin::Nexus** | San Francisco Bay Area | **The Input (Signal)** | 160,000+ Lead Database, ML Signal Refinery |
| **Ratuza AI** | Dhaka, Bangladesh | **The Output (Delivery)** | Implementation Capacity, AI Voice Agents, Custom Chatbots |

---

## 2. THE PARTNERSHIP ECONOMICS (FIXED)
Since Ratul/Ratuza operates without a proprietary lead-flow infrastructure, the revenue architecture is tiered based on **Status Equity** and **Strategic Input**.

### A. Pilot Phase (The "Strike List" Protocol)
*   **Profit Split:** **30% (Basin::Nexus) / 70% (Ratuza AI)** on Total Contract Value (TCV).
*   **Deliverable:** Basin::Nexus provides the "Hot Signal" and the "Architect Brief." Ratuza conducts the discovery and implementation.

### B. Scale Phase (The "Certified Partner" Protocol)
*   **Profit Split:** **40% (Basin::Nexus) / 60% (Ratuza AI)** on TCV.
*   **Deliverable:** As Basin::Nexus briefs become further productized, Ratuza shifts to 100% technical delivery.

## 3. CORE MANDATES

### I. Architectural Control
Basin::Nexus maintains **100% Architectural Veto**. Every solution deployed by Ratuza must be vetted by the Signal Refinery logic to ensure it meets SF-market standards. We solve for **Signal Fidelity**, not just "Automation Slop."

### II. Infrastructure Ownership
The **Real Estate Refinery** (and all future vertical sites) will be built and hosted on GitHub under the **Basin Leon** brand. Ratuza is listed as the *Certified Implementation Partner*.

### III. Pilot Target: Real Estate (Strike List 001)
My refinery has identified the following "High Latency" targets for this week's sprint:
*   **Woodmont Real Estate Services** (Regional Management)
*   **EAH Housing** (VP of Development)
*   **Maximus Real Estate Partners** (Resident Services)

---

## 4. NEXT ACTION STEPS
1.  **Confirm Agreement:** Acknowledge the Architectural Control mandate.
2.  **Verify Talent Stack:** Submit a list of current technical certifications (e.g., Vapi.ai, n8n, GHL).
3.  **Signal Release:** Basin::Nexus will release the full contact data and internal briefs for the first 5 Strike Targets.
