# 🏛️ BASIN::NEXUS ARCHITECTURAL PLAYBOOK

## Systems Governance for the GTM Orchestrator

This document serves as the **Written Law** for all AI agents and human collaborators in this workspace.

### 1. CORE PHILOSOPHY

- **GTM is Code:** Revenue is an engineering output. Every outreach, enrichment, and routing logic must be version-controlled, automated, and audited.
- **Agentic Gravity:** We don't solve for volume; we solve for signal density. High-gravity signals (e.g., job changes, funding, tech-stack shifts) actuate the system.

- **Layer 1: The Signal Refinery (Plan):** External data ingestion (Clay/Browser). 
- **Layer 2: The Logic Gates (Build):** Orchestration (n8n/Python). Rule-based filtering (Is this ICP? Is intent high?).
- **Layer 3: The Actuator (Verify):** Multi-agent verification and delivery (Sequence/LinkedIn/Slack).

### 3. DATA OWNERSHIP & INTEGRITY

- **System of Record:** Salesforce/HubSpot are *targets*, not primary logic sources. 
- **The Core Logic:** Lives in `gtm-stack/` and `BASIN::NEXUS` artifacts.
- **PII Policy:** Standard PII (Phone/Email) is transient and must be redacted from all public documentation/GitHub repos.

### 4. REVENUE "UNIT ECONOMICS"

- Every automated strike should be aimed at a $100k+ ARR opportunity. 
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) must be minimized through total system automation.
